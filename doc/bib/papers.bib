abstract = {This paper introduces an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for image restoration (deconvolution) based on a penalized likelihood formulated in the wavelet domain. Regularization is achieved by promoting a reconstruction with low-complexity, expressed in the wavelet coefficients, taking advantage of the well known sparsity of wavelet representations. Previous works have investigated wavelet-based restoration but, except for certain special cases, the resulting criteria are solved approximately or require demanding optimization methods. The EM algorithm herein proposed combines the efficient image representation offered by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with the diagonalization of the convolution operator obtained in the Fourier domain. Thus, it is a general-purpose approach to wavelet-based image restoration with computational complexity comparable to that of standard wavelet denoising schemes or of frequency domain deconvolution methods. The algorithm alternates between an E-step based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and a DWT-based M-step, resulting in an efficient iterative process requiring O(N log N) operations per iteration. The convergence behavior of the algorithm is investigated, and it is shown that under mild conditions the algorithm converges to a globally optimal restoration. Moreover, our new approach performs competitively with, in some cases better than, the best existing methods in benchmark tests.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial porin, or voltage-dependent anion channel, is a pore-forming protein first discovered in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Later investigations have provided indications for its presence also in other cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane, and in caveolae. This extra-mitochondrial localization is debated and no clear-cut conclusion has been reached up to now. In this work, we used biochemical and electrophysiological techniques to detect and characterize porin within isolated caveolae and caveolae-like domains (low density Triton-insoluble fractions). A new procedure was used to isolate porin from plasma membrane. The outer surface of cultured CEM cells was biotinylated by an impermeable reagent. Low density Triton-insoluble fractions were prepared from the labeled cells and used as starting material to purify a biotinylated protein with the same electrophoretic mobility and immunoreactivity of mitochondrial porin. In planar bilayers, the porin from these sources formed slightly anion-selective pores with properties indistinguishable from those of mitochondrial porin. This work thus provides a strong indication of the presence of porin in the plasma membrane, and specifically in caveolae and caveolae-like domains.},

abstract = {GABA concentration jump experiments performed on membrane patches predict that postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors will become desensitized following the release of the contents of a single GABA-containing synaptic vesicle. To examine this we used a single synaptic bouton stimulation technique to directly examine whether postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors in cultured cerebellar granule cells exhibit transmitter-induced desensitization. In a large number of recordings, no evidence was found for desensitization of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors by vesicularly released transmitter. This was the case even when as many as 40 vesicles were released from a single bouton within 1.5 s. In addition, postsynaptic depolarization and application of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam, manipulations previously shown to enhance desensitization of GABA(A) receptors, failed to unmask transmitter-induced desensitization. In contrast, a single 2- to 3-s application of a high concentration of exogenous GABA was able to depress synaptic responsiveness for up to 70 s. Furthermore, pharmacological depletion of GABA eliminated inhibitory synaptic communication, suggesting that GABA is the transmitter and the desensitization-resistant inhibitory postsynaptic currents are not mediated by a "nondesensitizing" ligand such as beta-alanine. Overall our data indicate that a specific desensitization-resistant population of GABA(A) receptors are present at postsynaptic sites on cultured cerebellar granule cells.},

abstract = {Deducing plausible reaction schemes from single-channel current traces is time-consuming and difficult. The goal is to find the simplest scheme that fits the data, but there are many ways to connect even a small number of states (>2 million schemes with four open and four closed states). Many schemes make identical predictions. An exhaustive search over model space does not address the many equivalent schemes that will result. We have found a canonical form that can express all reaction schemes for binary channels. This form has the minimal number of rate constants for any rank (number of independent open-closed transitions), unlike other canonical forms such as the well established "uncoupled" scheme. Because all of the interconductance transitions in the new form are independent, we refer to it as the manifest interconductance rank (MIR) form. In the case of four open and four closed states, there are four MIR form schemes, corresponding to ranks 1-4. For many models proposed in the literature for specific ion channels, the equivalent MIR form has dramatically fewer links than the uncoupled form. By using the MIR form we prove that all rank 1 topologies with a given number of open and closed states make identical predictions in steady state, thus narrowing the search space for simple models. Moreover, we prove that fitting to canonical form preserves detailed balance. We also propose an efficient hierarchical algorithm for searching for the simplest possible model consistent with a given data set.},

abstract = {Glutamate receptors of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA type serve different functions during excitatory synaptic transmission. Although many central neurons bear both types of receptor, the evidence concerning the sensitivity of cerebellar Purkinje cells to NMDA is contradictory. To investigate the receptor types present in Purkinje cells, we have used whole-cell and outside-out patch-clamp methods to record from cells in thin cerebellar slices from young rats. At a holding potential of -70 mV (in nominally Mg(2+)-free medium, with added glycine) NMDA caused a whole-cell current response which consisted of a dramatic increase in the frequency of synaptic currents. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) and the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor antagonist bicuculline, spontaneous synaptic currents and responses to NMDA were inhibited. In a proportion of cells a small polysynaptic response to NMDA persisted, which was further reduced by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-2,3-dihydro-7-nitroquinoxalinedione (CNQX). The non-NMDA glutamate receptor agonists kainate (KA), quisqualate (QA) and s-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (s-AMPA), evoked large inward currents due to the direct activation of receptors in Purkinje cells. NMDA applied to excised membrane patches failed to evoke any single-channel currents, whereas s-AMPA and QA caused small inward currents accompanied by marked increases in current noise. Spectral analysis of the s-AMPA noise in patches gave an estimated mean channel conductance of approximately 4 pS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Primary afferent depolarizations (PADs) are associated with presynaptic inhibition in both vertebrates and invertebrates. In the present study, we have used both anatomical and electrophysiological techniques to analyze the relative importance of shunting mechanisms versus sodium channel inactivation in mediating the decrease of action potential amplitude, and thereby presynaptic inhibition. Experiments were performed in sensory afferents of a stretch receptor in an in vitro preparation of the crayfish. Lucifer yellow intracellular labeling of sensory axons combined with GABA immunohistochemistry revealed close appositions between GABA-immunoreactive (ir) fibers and sensory axons. Most contacts were located on the main axon at the entry zone of the ganglion, close to the first branching point within the ganglion. By comparison, the output synapses of sensory afferents to target neurons were located on distal branches. The location of synaptic inputs mediating spontaneous PADs was also determined electrophysiologically by making dual intracellular recordings from single sensory axons. Inputs generating PADs appear to occur around the first axonal branching point, in agreement with the anatomical data. In this region, small PADs (3-15 mV) produced a marked reduction of action potential amplitude, whereas depolarization of the membrane potential by current injection up to 15 mV had no effect. These results suggest that the decrease of the amplitude of action potentials by single PADs results from a shunting mechanism but does not seem to involve inactivation of sodium channels. Our results also suggest that GABAergic presynaptic inhibition may act as a global control mechanism to block transmission through certain reflex pathways.},

abstract = {The time pattern of intracranial pressure (ICP) in response to typical clinical tests (i.e., bolus injection and bolus withdrawal of 1 to 4 mL of saline in the craniospinal space) was studied in 18 patients with acute brain damage by means of a mathematical model. The model includes the main biomechanical factors assumed to affect intracranial pressure, particularly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, intracranial compliance, and cerebral hemodynamics. Best fitting between model simulation curves and clinical tracings was achieved using the Powell minimization algorithm and a least-square criterion function. The simulation results demonstrate that, in most patients, the ICP time pattern cannot be explained merely on the basis of CSF dynamics but also requires consideration of the contribution of cerebral hemodynamics and blood volume alterations. In particular, only in a few patients (about 40% of total) the ICP monotonically returns toward baseline following the clinical maneuver. In most of the examined cases (about 60%), ICP exhibits an anomalous response to the same maneuver, characterized by a delayed increase after bolus injection and a delayed decrease after withdrawal. The model is able to explain these responses, imputing them to active intracranial blood volume changes induced by mechanisms controlling cerebral blood flow. Finally, the role of the main intracranial biomechanical parameters in the genesis of the ICP time pattern is discussed and a comparison with previous theoretical studies performed.},

abstract = {Contrary to a century-old belief that dendritic spines are stable storage sites of long term memory, the emerging picture from a recent flurry of exciting observations using novel high resolution imaging methods of living cells in culture is that of a dynamic structure, which undergoes fast morphological changes over periods of hours and even minutes. Concurrently, the nature of stimuli which cause formation or collapse of dendritic spines has changed from a mysterious Hebbian-governed plasticity producing stimulus to the more trivial activation of the synapse by strong/weak stimulation. The molecular mechanisms underlying spine plasticity are beginning to emerge; the role of presynaptic and/or postsynaptic activity, genetic, central or local factors in the formation and retraction of spines are currently being analyzed. A common mechanism for both, formation/elongation and pruning/retraction of spines, involving changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), is emerging. It appears that [Ca(2+)](i) is related to changes in spines in a bell shape form: lack of synaptic activity causes transient outgrowth of filopodia but eventual elimination of spines, a moderate rise in [Ca(2+)](i) causes elongation of existing spines and formation of new ones, while a massive increase in [Ca(2+)](i) such as that seen in seizure activity, causes fast shrinkage and eventual collapse of spines. Nuclear signals (e.g. CREB), activated by an increase in [Ca(2+)](i), are involved in the central regulation of spine formation, while spine shrinkage and elongation are probably triggered by local [Ca(2+)](i) changes. This hypothesis provides a parsimonious explanation for conflicting reports on activity-dependent changes in dendritic spine morphology. Still, the many differences between cultured neurons, with which most of current studies are conducted, and the neuron in the real brain, require a cautious extrapolation of current assumptions on the regulation of spine formation.},

abstract = {Nonstationary noise analysis of electrophysiological data is applied to the estimation of the single-channel current, i, and the number of active channels, N(C), whenever they cannot be determined directly due to limited resolution. Using least squares methods, the accuracy of estimating i and N(C) chiefly depends on the statistical error of the ensemble variance. It is shown that if the correlation among the binned data points is taken into account correctly, the variability of i and N(C) can be remarkably reduced and exact confidence limits of the parameters can be calculated. Least-squares methods are introduced which consider the measured error-covariance matrix of the binned variance in a model-independent fashion. Employing Monte Carlo methods, it is demonstrated that both the error predictions and the confidence limits are correct. The method is used to investigate the performance of nonstationary noise analysis at low channel open-probabilities. The application of the approach to simulated data as well as to experimental, i.e. non-ideal, data is discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECT:Control of intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is the foundation of traumatic brain injury (TBI) management. In this study, the authors examined whether conventional ICP- and CPP-guided neurocritical care ensures adequate brain tissue O2 in the first 6 hours after resuscitation.

METHODS:Resuscitated patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score < or = 8 and Injury Severity Scale score > or = 16) who were admitted to a Level I trauma center and who underwent brain tissue O2 monitoring within 6 hours of injury were evaluated as part of a prospective observational database. Therapy was directed to maintain an ICP of 25 mm Hg or less and a CPP of 60 mm Hg or higher. Data from a group of 25 patients that included 19 men and six women (mean age 39 +/- 20 years) were examined. After resuscitation, ICP was 25 mm Hg or less in 84% and CPP was 60 mm Hg or greater in 88% of the patients. Brain O2 probes were allowed to stabilize; the initial brain tissue O2 level was 25 mm Hg or less in 68% of the patients, 20 mm Hg or less in 56%, and 10 mm Hg or less in 36%. Nearly one third (29%) of patients with ICP readings of 25 mm Hg or less and 27% with CPP levels of 60 mm Hg or greater had severe cerebral hypoxia (brain tissue O2 < or = 10 mm Hg). Nineteen patients had both optimal ICP (< 25 mm Hg) and CPP (> 60 mm Hg); brain tissue O2 was 20 mm Hg or less in 47% and 10 mm Hg or less in 21% of these patients. The mortality rate was higher in patients with reduced brain tissue O2.

CONCLUSIONS:Brain resuscitation based on current neurocritical care standards (that is, control of ICP and CPP) does not prevent cerebral hypoxia in some patients. This finding may help explain why secondary neuronal injury occurs in some patients with adequate CPP and suggests that the definition of adequate brain resuscitation after TBI may need to be reconsidered.},

We used whole-cell and single-channel recording to examine NMDA receptors on acutely dissociated Purkinje cells from newborn rats (postnatal day 0-4). 2. NMDA channels were present on > 80% of identified Purkinje cells and had pharmacological and single-channel properties that were indistinguishable from NMDA receptors on other neurons. In particular, responses were glycine-dependent and Mg2+ produced flickery open-channel block. 3. Our results demonstrate the transient expression of NMDA receptor/channels on Purkinje cells early in development. As NMDA receptors have been implicated in developmental plasticity in other regions of the CNS, a similar role is feasible during climbing fiber innervation of Purkinje cells.},

abstract = {OBJECT:Cerebral ischemia is the leading cause of preventable death in cases of major trauma with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Intracranial pressure (ICP) control and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) manipulation have significantly reduced the mortality but not the morbidity rate in these patients. In this study, the authors describe their 5-year experience with brain tissue oxygen (PbtO(2)) monitoring, and the effect of a brain tissue oxygen-directed critical care guide (PbtO(2)-CCG) on the 6-month clinical outcome (based on the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale score) in patients with TBIs.

METHODS:One hundred thirty-nine patients admitted to Creighton University Medical Center with major traumatic injuries (Injury Severity Scale [ISS] scores >or= 16) and TBI underwent prospective evaluation. All patients were treated with a PbtO(2)-CCG to maintain a brain oxygen level > 20 mm Hg, and control ICP < 20 mm Hg. The role of demographic, clinical, and imaging parameters in the identification of patients at risk for cerebral hypooxygenation and the influence of hypooxygenation on clinical outcome were recorded. Outcomes were compared with those in a historical ICP/CPP patient cohort. Subgroup analysis of severe TBI was performed and compared to data reported in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank.

RESULTS:The majority of injuries were sustained in motor vehicle crashes (63%), and diffuse brain injury was the most common abnormality (58%). Mechanism of injury, severity of TBI, pathological entity, neuroimaging results, and trauma indices were not predictive of ischemia. Factors affecting death included gunshot injury, poor trauma indices, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and coma. After standard resuscitation, 65% of patients had an initially low PbtO(2). Data are presented as means +/- SDs. Treatment with the PbtO(2)-CCG resulted in a 44% improvement in mean PbtO(2) (16.21 +/- 12.30 vs 23.65 +/- 14.40 mm Hg; p < 0.001), control of ICP (mean 12.76 +/- 6.42 mm Hg), and the maintenance of CPP (mean 76.13 +/- 15.37 mm Hg). Persistently low cerebral oxygenation was seen in 37% of patients at 2 hours, 31% at 24 hours, and 18% at 48 hours of treatment. Thus elevated ICP and a persistent low PbtO(2) after 2 hours represented increasing odds of death (OR 14.3 at 48 hours). Survivors and patients with good outcomes generally had significantly higher mean daily PbtO(2) and CPP values compared to nonsurvivors. Polytrauma, associated with higher ISS scores, presented an increased risk of vegetative outcome (OR 9.0). Compared to the ICP/CPP cohort, the mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 6 months in patients treated with PbtO(2)-CCG was higher (3.55 +/- 1.75 vs 2.71 +/- 1.65, p < 0.01; OR for good outcome 2.09, 95% CI 1.031-4.24) as was the reduction in mortality rate (25.9 vs 41.50%; relative risk reduction 37%), despite higher ISS scores in the PbtO(2) group (31.6 +/- 13.4 vs 27.1 +/- 8.9; p < 0.05). Subgroup analysis of severe closed TBI revealed a significant relative risk reduction in mortality rate of 37-51% compared with the Traumatic Coma Data Bank data, and an increased OR for good outcome especially in patients with diffuse brain injury without mass lesions (OR 4.9, 95% CI 2.9-8.4).

CONCLUSIONS:The prevention and aggressive treatment of cerebral hypooxygenation and control of ICP with a PbtO(2)-directed protocol reduced the mortality rate after TBI in major trauma, but more importantly, resulted in improved 6-month clinical outcomes over the standard ICP/CPP-directed therapy at the authors' institution.},

abstract = {Reaction networks are a general formalism for describing collections of classical entities interacting in a random way. While reaction networks are mainly studied by chemists, they are equivalent to Petri nets, which are used for similar purposes in computer science and biology. As noted by Doi and others, techniques from quantum field theory can be adapted to apply to such systems. Here we use these techniques to study how the "master equation" describing stochastic time evolution for a reaction network reduces is related to the "rate equation" describing the deterministic evolution of the expected number of particles of each species in the large-number limit. We show that the relation is especially strong when a solution of master equation is a "coherent state", meaning that the numbers of entities of each kind are described by independent Poisson distributions.},

abstract = {The magnitude of the pulsatile intracranial pressure variations (CSF pulse pressure) is determined by the elastance of the craniospinal system and by the magnitude of the pulsatile variations in cerebral blood volume (CBV). The pulsatile change in CBV is, among other factors, determined by the compliance of the cerebral vascular bed which, in its turn, is dependent on the cerebral vasomotor tone. This concept has led the authors to devise a method for the assessment of both the elastance and the state of the cerebral vasomotor tone based on the relationship between CSF pulse pressure and intracranial pressure. This relationship was found to be of a linear nature both in clinical patients and in experimental animals. A significant, positive correlation was found between the slope of this relationship and the value of the craniospinal volume-pressure relationship: the elastance coefficient. During elevation of the intracranial pressure a breakpoint was observed in the relationship between CSF pulse pressure and the intracranial pressure above which the pulse pressure increased more rapidly. The elastance remained constant above this breakpoint. The same phenomenon was observed during plateau waves in clinical patients. Induced changes in systemic arterial pressure produced opposite effects on CSF pulse pressure and elastance coefficient. In these cases the discrepancy between pulse pressure and elastance was attributed to the pulsatile changes in CBV and this could be verified by means of electromagnetic flowmetry. The advantage of this method is that all the information is contained within the intracranial pressure signal itself, from which it can be extracted by simple means without the use of invasive tests.},

abstract = {The estimation of a large number of parameters in metabolic systems from few measurements is a difficult and important problem. A three-compartment model of the cellular cardiac metabolism depends on a large number of parameters, many of which are nonphysical. The model consists of a large system of stiff nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics of the concentrations in the three compartments during ischemia. The data are limited to measured concentrations at few observation times, thus making the inverse problem severely under-determined and ill-posed. The problem is modelled in a Bayesian framework where we relate the unknown parameters to the data through conditional probability density functions. This setting allows us to import necessary a priori knowledge about the model into the estimation process to guide us towards a meaningful solution. The methods for the parameter estimation combine numerical methods for unconstrained optimization and Monte Carlo-based statistical sampling techniques.},

abstract = {At the cerebellar synapse between the parallel fibers (PFs) and the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, we have found that application of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) reversibly depresses the postsynaptic current. We present evidence that this depression involves NMDA receptors located on the presynaptic axons and requires that the NMDA application be combined with action potentials in the PFs. Unexpectedly, unlike other modulations mediated by presynaptic receptors, the NMDA-induced inhibition does not involve a depression of transmitter release. Because it is blocked by both nitric oxide synthase and soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitors, we propose that it involves a trans-synaptic mechanism in which NO released by the PFs decreases the glutamate sensitivity of the Purkinje cell.},

The system we have devised is composed of 6 elements. First, we have developed a method using a scanning transmissionelectron microscope to make apertures of<500A in a regular array. Second, we have demonstrated that in a variety of materials light of 5000A is readily transmitted through these apertures. Third, we have used the theoretical and experimental results of electrodynamics demonstrating that light in near field is directed rather than diffracted. Fourth, we have employed a technique of internal reflectance to limit the information in all three directions to {\textasciitilde}500A. Fifth, we have developed a scanning stage that can be translated in 100A steps. Sixth, we use the developments of low light level multichannel detection laser spectroscopy. The integration of these components and concepts into a workable scanning nanometer optical spectral microscope will be discussed and resolution tests and detection limits for the instrument will be presented.},

Key advantages of this method are that the biomolecules are always in solution and the applied voltage provides fine control of the delivery down to the single molecule level. Two consecutive cycles of deposition, to produce spatially varying features with different biological properties, were demonstrated with fluorescently labeled antibodies or biotin. This approach combines "top-down" fabrication, using the nanopen for local application, and "bottom-up" fabrication, using molecular recognition for self-assembly at defined positions, and opens up new possibilities in nanotechnology.},

abstract = {A method is described for monitoring the relationship between CSF pulse pressure and ICP in clinical patients. Highly significant linear relationships were found during 65 continuous ICP recordings in 58 patients. The slope value of this relationship showed a positive correlation with the elastance coefficient, a volume-pressure parameter assessed by bolus injection. However, the correlation was too weak to allow for a confident prediction of the elastance coefficient on the basis of CSF pulse pressure in the individual patient. This was attributed to the variable magnitude of the volume change underlying the CSF pulse pressure: the pulsatile variation in cerebral blood volume. This quantity was calculated on the basis of a mathematical model from the slope value and the elastance coefficient and was found to vary between 0.36 and 4.38 ml. During plateau waves a disproportionate increase in pulse pressure with the ICP was observed in contrast with a relative decrease in intracranial elastance. This phenomenon was ascribed to an increase in the pulsatile variation in cerebral blood volume. It is concluded that, under certain conditions, the intracranial volume-pressure relationship can be continuously monitored by means of CSF pulse pressure analysis. The findings during plateau waves suggest that the pulse pressure also reflects the state of the cerebral vasomotor tone.},

abstract = {Synaptic vesicles are responsible for releasing neurotransmitters and are thus essential to brain function. The classical mode of vesicle recycling includes full collapse of the vesicle into the plasma membrane and clathrin-mediated regeneration of a new vesicle. In contrast, a nonclassical mode known as "kiss-and-run" features fusion by a transient fusion pore without complete loss of vesicle identity and offers possible advantages for increasing the throughput of neurotransmission. Studies of vesicular traffic have benefited greatly from fluorescent probes like FM dyes and synaptopHluorin. However, intrinsic properties of these probes limit their ability to provide a simple and precise distinction between classical and nonclassical modes. Here we report a novel optical probe specific to full collapse fusion, capitalizing on the size and superior photo-properties of photoluminescent quantum dots (Qdots). Qdots with exposed carboxyl groups were readily taken up by synaptic vesicles in an activity-, Ca(2+)-, and clathrin-dependent manner. Electron microscopy showed that Qdots were harbored within individual vesicles in a 1:1 ratio. The release of Qdots was activity- and Ca(2+)-dependent, similar to FM dyes. As artificial cargo, approximately 15 nm in diameter, Qdots will not escape vesicles during kiss-and-run but only with full collapse fusion. Strikingly, Qdots unloaded with kinetics substantially slower than destaining of FM dye, indicating that full-collapse fusion contributed only a fraction of all fusion events. As a full-collapse-fusion-responsive reporter, Qdots will likely promote better understanding of vesicle recycling at small CNS nerve terminals.},

abstract = {Cerebellar basket cells form highly specialized inhibitory synaptic contacts with Purkinje cells, namely the pericellular basket and pinceau nerve terminal structures, wrapping around the Purkinje cell somatic and axon hillock regions. These inhibitory synaptic contacts are ideally located to control the ultimate output of the cerebellar cortex. Previous immunohistochemical studies have shown that these synaptic structures possess a very high density of the dendrotoxin (DTX)-sensitive potassium channel subunit, Kv1.2. We have taken advantage of this unique anatomical arrangement offering a high concentration of identified Kv channel subunits by combining whole-cell patch-clamp recording and fluorescence microscopy to establish a novel preparation and perform the first recordings from unambiguously identified mammalian CNS inhibitory presynaptic terminals. We report that DTX-sensitive potassium channels are present in basket cell terminals but not in the basket cell soma. This selective cellular distribution suggests that these channels play an important role in modulating cerebellar inhibitory synaptic transmission.},

abstract = {By the end of the first week in culture, hippocampal neurons have established a single axon and several dendrites. These 2 classes of processes differ in their morphology, in their molecular composition, and in their synaptic polarity (Bartlett and Banker, 1984a, b; Caceres et al., 1984). We examined the events during the first week in culture that lead to the establishment of this characteristic form. Hippocampal cells were obtained from 18 d fetal rats, plated onto polylysine-treated coverslips, and maintained in a serum-free medium. The development of individual cells was followed by sequential photography at daily intervals until both axons and dendrites had been established; identification of the processes was confirmed by immunostaining for MAP2, a dendritic marker. Time-lapse video recording was used to follow the early stages of process formation. Hippocampal neurons acquired their characteristic form by a stereotyped sequence of developmental events. The cells first established several, apparently identical, short processes. After several hours, one of the short processes began to grow very rapidly; it became the axon. The remaining processes began to elongate a few days later and grew at a much slower rate. They became the cell's dendrites. Neurons that arose following mitosis in culture underwent this same sequence of developmental events. In a few instances, 2 processes from a cell exhibited the rapid growth typical of axons, but only one maintained this growth; the other retracted and became a dendrite. Axons branched primarily by the formation of collaterals, not by bifurcation of growth cones. As judged by light microscopy, processes are not specified as axons or dendrites when they arise. The first manifestation of neuronal polarity is the acquisition of axonal characteristics by one of the initial processes; subsequently the remaining processes become dendrites.},

abstract = {Cytochrome oxidase is the terminal electron acceptor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is responsible for the vast majority of oxygen consumption in the body and essential for the efficient generation of cellular ATP. The enzyme contains four redox active metal centres; one of these, the binuclear CuA centre, has a strong absorbance in the near-infrared that enables it to be detectable in vivo by near-infrared spectroscopy. However, the fact that the concentration of this centre is less than 10% of that of haemoglobin means that its detection is not a trivial matter. Unlike the case with deoxyhaemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin, concentration changes of the total cytochrome oxidase protein occur very slowly (over days) and are therefore not easily detectable by near-infrared spectroscopy. However, the copper centre rapidly accepts and donates an electron, and can thus change its redox state quickly; this redox change is detectable by near-infrared spectroscopy. Many factors can affect the CuA redox state in vivo (Cooper et al. 1994), but most significant is likely to be the molecular oxygen concentration (at low oxygen tensions, electrons build up on CuA as reduction of oxygen by the enzyme starts to limit the steady-state rate of electron transfer). The factors underlying haemoglobin oxygenation, deoxygenation and blood volume changes are, in general, well understood by the clinicians and physiologists who perform near-infrared spectroscopy measurements. In contrast, the factors that control the steady-state redox level of CuA in cytochrome oxidase are still a matter of active debate, even amongst biochemists studying the isolated enzyme and mitochondria. Coupled with the difficulties of accurate in vivo measurements it is perhaps not surprising that the field of cytochrome oxidase near-infrared spectroscopy has a somewhat chequered past. Too often papers have been written with insufficient information to enable the measurements to be repeated and few attempts have been made to test the algorithms in vivo. In recent years a number of research groups and commercial spectrometer manufacturers have made a concerted attempt to not only say how they are attempting to measure cytochrome oxidase by near-infrared spectroscopy but also to demonstrate that they are really doing so. We applaud these attempts, which in general fall into three areas: first, modelling of data can be performed to determine what problems are likely to derail cytochrome oxidase detection algorithms (Matcher et al. 1995); secondly haemoglobin concentration changes can be made by haemodilution (using saline or artificial blood substitutes) in animals (Tamura 1993) or patients (Skov {\&} Greisen 1994); and thirdly, the cytochrome oxidase redox state can be fixed by the use of mitochondrial inhibitors and then attempts make to cause spurious cytochrome changes by dramatically varying haemoglobin oxygenation, haemoglobin concentration and light scattering (Cooper et al. 1997). We have previously written reviews covering the difficulties of measuring the cytochrome near-infrared spectroscopy signal in vivo (Cooper et al. 1997) and the factors affecting the oxidation state of cytochrome oxidase CuA (Cooper et al. 1994). In this article we would like to strike a somewhat more optimistic note--we will stress the usefulness this measurement may have in the clinical environment, as well as describing conditions under which we can have confidence that we are measuring real changes in the CuA redox state.},

abstract = {Following postsynaptic activation of a pyramidal cell, the degree of GABAergic synaptic inhibition that the cell receives is reduced dramatically for many seconds. Previously, we found that induction of depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) required post-synaptic increases in intracellular [Ca2+], but absence of a decrease in responsiveness to iontophoretically applied GABA left the mechanism of DSI expression uncertain. We investigated DSI with whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in rat hippocampal slices. Bath-applied carbachol was ordinarily used to increase the spontaneous action potential-induced IPSCs (sIPSCs) and enhance detectability of DSI; synaptically released ACh has the same effects. TTX-sensitive sIPSCs are markedly reduced by DSI, whereas TTX-insensitive miniature IPSC amplitudes do not change, suggesting that DSI represents a retrograde influence on presynaptic GABA release. A lag (approximately 1 s) prior to maximal DSI and prevention of DSI by pertussis toxin pointed to a G protein-linked second messenger that may be presynaptic, since perturbation of postsynaptic G protein function did not alter DSI.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological recording of single-channel currents is the most direct method available for obtaining detailed and precise information about the kinetic behavior of ion channels. A wide variety of cell types can be used for single-channel recording, but to obtain the highest resolution of the briefest channel opening and closing events, low-noise recordings, coupled with a minimal filtering frequency, are required. Here, we present a protocol designed to help those with some electrophysiological expertise who wish to explore the properties of native and recombinant single ligand-gated ion channels. We have focused on the practical aspects of recording single GABA channels from cell-attached and outside-out patches and also introduced some of the preliminary considerations that are necessary for the analysis of single-channel data, including an introduction to single-channel analysis software.},

abstract = {The inherent complexity of cellular signaling networks and their importance to a wide range of cellular functions necessitates the development of modeling methods that can be applied toward making predictions and highlighting the appropriate experiments to test our understanding of how these systems are designed and function. We use methods of statistical mechanics to extract useful predictions for complex cellular signaling networks. A key difficulty with signaling models is that, while significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for individual steps in these networks, many of the parameters required to describe their behavior remain unknown or at best represent estimates. To establish the usefulness of our approach, we have applied our methods toward modeling the nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of neuronal cells. In particular, we study the actions of NGF and mitogenic epidermal growth factor (EGF) in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Through a network of intermediate signaling proteins, each of these growth factors stimulates extracellular regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation with distinct dynamical profiles. Using our modeling approach, we are able to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response to the two growth factors. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular systems, highlighting an inherent property of these systems that we call 'sloppiness.'},

abstract = {In recent years, it has become clear that, in addition to conventional anterograde transmission, signaling in neural circuits can occur in a retrograde manner. This suggests the additional possibility that postsynaptic release of neurotransmitter might be able to act in an autocrine fashion. Here, we show that brief depolarization of a cerebellar Purkinje cell triggers a slow inward current. This depolarization-induced slow current (DISC) is attenuated by antagonists of mGluR1 or TRP channels. DISC is eliminated by a mixture of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel blockers and is mimicked by a brief climbing fiber burst. DISC is attenuated by an inhibitor of vesicular glutamate transporters or of vesicular fusion. These data suggest that Ca2+-dependent postsynaptic fusion of glutamate-loaded vesicles evokes a slow inward current produced by activation of postsynaptic mGluR1, thereby constituting a useful form of feedback regulation.},

abstract = {The currents through single acetylcholine-activated channels were measured on membrane fragments that had been torn from rat muscle myotubes with patch pipettes. The membrane fragments were sealed into the pipette by using the "gigohm-seal" technique of Neher, which also permitted voltage clamp of the membrane via the patch electrode. Membrane patches were excited by sudden withdrawal of the electrode from the cell. Substitution of fluoride for chloride ions in the bathing solution could prevent or reverse the tendency for the membrane at the electrode tip to seal over into a closed vesicle. The single membrane layer at the electrode tip could remain functional for up to 30 min. The apparent single channel conductance was minimally affected by excision. The current-voltage relationships for the single channel currents show that the inside (i.e., cytoplasmic surface) of the membrane fragment was exposed to the bathing solution. In symmetric Na solutions the current-voltage curve was nearly linear and reversed at approximately 0 mV. In other bathing solutions from 40 to 500 mM NaF, the observed zero current potential was close to that predicted by the Nernst equation. We present evidence that internal Na interacts with the channel, causing both saturation of outward current and block of inward current. At + 100 mV the apparent dissociation constant for internal Na was 138 mM.},

abstract = {The molecular layer of the cerebellum of the frog Rana temporaria was studied by light and electron microscopy after electrical stimulation in the presence of an NO-generating compound. In these conditions, there was severe swelling of granule cell axon terminals (boutons) and astrocyte processes (AP), with loss of cytoplasmic elements. However, along with damaged structures, there were also undamaged structures: boutons with synaptic vesicles and AP with glycogen granules. It is suggested that these persisting viable AP may form 1) glial "wrappings" around damaged synapses or boutons and 2) neuron-glial contacts, which form when synaptic vesicles cross damaged bouton membranes to AP containing glycogen granules. It is also suggested that the presence of glycogen in AP in conditions of oxygen and glucose deficiency may provide a source of high-energy substrates such as glucose and ATP, thus providing conditions for neuron survival in pathological states (ischemia/hypoxia).},

abstract = {Endocannabinoids serve as retrograde messengers in many brain regions. These diffusible lipophilic molecules are released by postsynaptic cells and regulate presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Here we describe an additional mechanism that mediates the spread of endocannabinoid signaling to distant inhibitory synapses. Depolarization of cerebellar Purkinje cells reduced the firing rate of nearby interneurons, and this reduction in firing was blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 also reduced firing rates in interneurons, and this inhibition arose from the activation of a small potassium conductance. Thus, endocannabinoids released from the dendrites of depolarized neurons can lead to inhibition of firing in nearby cells. Because interneurons can project over several hundred micrometers, this inhibition of firing allows cells to regulate synaptic inputs at distances well beyond the limits of endocannabinoid diffusion.},

abstract = {To study the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the perpendicular orientation of stellate and/or basket cells to the direction of fasciculating granule cell neurites, we have used cultures of microexplants from early postnatal mouse cerebellum that show this cellular behaviour in vitro. When these cultures were maintained in the presence of antibodies to the neural cell adhesion molecules L1 and N-CAM or immunoglobulin-like domains I, II and IV of N-CAM, the resulting decrease or increase in the fasciculation of granule cell neurites changed the perpendicular orientation and morphology of the small inhibitory interneurons. Additives which did not perturb fasciculation did not affect the perpendicular orientation and morphology of stellate and/or basket cells. Furthermore, when perturbation of fasciculation was prevented, neither L1 nor N-CAM antibodies modified the positioning or morphology of interneurons. These observations indicate that ordered fasciculation of granule cell neurites is an important parameter in the perpendicular orientation and elaboration of the typical morphology of the small cerebellar inhibitory interneurons.},

abstract = {1. Our aim was to identify the small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel(s) (SK) underlying the apamin-sensitive afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurones. 2. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed to the putative calmodulin-binding domain conserved in all mammalian SK channel sequences were employed to detect SK DNA in a cDNA library from rat SCG. Only a single band, corresponding to a fragment of the rSK3 gene, was amplified. 3. Northern blot analysis employing a PCR-generated rSK3 fragment showed the presence of mRNA coding for SK3 in SCG as well in other rat peripheral tissues including adrenal gland and liver. 4. The same rSK3 fragment enabled the isolation of a full-length rSK3 cDNA from the library. Its sequence was closely similar to, but not identical with, that of the previously reported rSK3 gene. 5. Expression of the rSK3 gene in mammalian cell lines (CHO, HEK cells) caused the appearance of a K(+) conductance with SK channel properties. 6. The application of selective SK blocking agents (including apamin, scyllatoxin and newer non-peptidic compounds) showed these homomeric SK3 channels to have essentially the same pharmacological characteristics as the SCG afterhyperpolarization, but to differ from those of homomeric SK1 and SK2 channels. 7. Immunohistochemistry using a rSK3 antipeptide antibody revealed the presence of SK3 protein in the cell bodies and processes of cultured SCG neurones. 8. Taken together, these results identify SK3 as a major component of the SK channels responsible for the afterhyperpolarization of cultured rat SCG neurones.},

abstract = {In twelve anaesthetised, ventilated dogs the effects of hypercapnia and pharmacologically induced arterial hypotension and hypertension on the interrelation between volume-pressure response (VPR) and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) pulse pressure were studied during continuous inflation of a supratentorial extradural balloon. Hypercapnia did not significantly affect the intracranial volume-pressure relationships, but did cause a significant increase in gradient of the relationship between CSF pulse pressure and intracranial pressure (ICP). Alteration of the arterial blood pressure showed opposite effects on VPR and CSF pulse pressure. A decrease in VPR and an increase in pulse pressure were observed during arterial hypotension; the reverse was found during arterial hypertension. The discrepancy between the effects on VPR and CSF pulse pressure of the variables under study was explained by changes in the transient increase in cerebral blood volume per cardiac cycle. On the basis of the results of this study it will be possible, during clinical ICP monitoring, to interpret changes in the CSF pulse pressure to ICP ratio in terms of changes in intracranial volume-pressure relationships.},

Several models indicate, as did the initial voltage clamp measurements, that the calcium concentration triggering such release could be very high at the entry site and that this concentration should be very short lasting. In order to determine this time course, calcium entry was studied at the squid giant synapse by imaging light emission from n-aequorin-J, intracellularly injected into the presynaptic terminal. The imaging utilized a video system capable of acquiring 4000 frames per sec. The results indicate that the calcium entry, triggered by action potentials, reaches a peak within 200 musec and has an overall duration of close to 800 musec, closely matching the duration of the presynaptic calcium current determined by voltage clamp results under similar conditions.},

The channel is selective for chloride over cations, and has an average single channel conductance of 382 picosiemens in symmetric 140 millimoles of chloride. In addition to the main conductance state it shows well-defined subconductance states of about 50, 100, 150 and 200 picosiemens. The channel is very active at membrane potentials close to 0 mV, but steps to either positive or negative membrane potentials above +/- 20 millivolt lead to a rapid inactivation of the channel. Changes in the concentrations of free calcium or adenosine tri-phosphate on the cytosolic surface do not influence channel activity. The chloride channel rarely opens at resting membrane potential, but it may help repolarize endothelial cells following depolarizing stimuli.},

Important functional domains of glutamate receptors, such as the ligand-binding domain, the channel pore, and the channel gate, are conserved in NR3B. NR3B mRNA was expressed highly in pons, midbrain, medulla, and the spinal cord, but at low levels in the forebrain and the cerebellum. Although NR3A mRNA expression decreases sharply after the second postnatal weeks, NR3B mRNA expression levels in whole brain were constant during postnatal development and into adult. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that NR3B could form NMDA receptor complex with NR1a and NR2A subunits in heterologous cells. Although expression of NR3B alone did not reconstitute functional NMDA receptors, coexpression of NR3B reduced the Ca(2+) permeability of glutamate-induced currents in cells expressing NR1a and NR2A. These results indicate that NR3B is a dominant modulatory subunit that can modify the function of NMDA receptors. Since high Ca(2+) permeability of NMDA receptors is thought to be a key feature for NMDA receptors to play critical roles in neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal death, NR3B may contribute to the regulation of these physiological and pathological processes.},

abstract = {Many types of neurons release endocannabinoids from their dendrites in response to elevation of intracellular calcium levels. Endocannabinoids then activate presynaptic cannabinoid receptors, thereby inhibiting neurotransmitter release for tens of seconds. A crucial step in understanding the physiological role of this retrograde signaling is to determine its sensitivity to elevations of postsynaptic calcium. Here we determine and compare the calcium dependence of endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde inhibition at three types of synapses onto cerebellar Purkinje cells. Previous studies have shown that Purkinje cell depolarization results in endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde inhibition of synapses received from climbing fibers, granule cell parallel fibers, and inhibitory interneurons. Using several calcium indicators with a range of affinities, we performed a series of in situ and in vitro calibrations to quantify calcium levels in Purkinje cells. We found that postsynaptic calcium levels of approximately 15 microM are required for half-maximal retrograde inhibition at all of these synapses. In contrast, previous studies had suggested that endocannabinoid release could occur with slight elevations of calcium above resting levels, which implies that inhibition should be widespread and continuously modulated by subtle changes in intracellular calcium levels. However, our results indicate that such small changes in intracellular calcium are not sufficient to evoke endocannabinoid release. Instead, because of its high requirement for calcium, retrograde inhibition mediated by calcium-dependent endocannabinoid release from Purkinje cells will occur under more restricted conditions and with greater spatial localization than previously appreciated.},

abstract = {We propose a novel nonnegative matrix factorization model that aims at finding localized, part-based, representations of nonnegative multivariate data items. Unlike the classical nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) technique, this new model, denoted "nonsmooth nonnegative matrix factorization" (nsNMF), corresponds to the optimization of an unambiguous cost function designed to explicitly represent sparseness, in the form of nonsmoothness, which is controlled by a single parameter. In general, this method produces a set of basis and encoding vectors that are not only capable of representing the original data, but they also extract highly localized patterns, which generally lend themselves to improved interpretability. The properties of this new method are illustrated with several data sets. Comparisons to previously published methods show that the new nsNMF method has some advantages in keeping faithfulness to the data in the achieving a high degree of sparseness for both the estimated basis and the encoding vectors and in better interpretability of the factors.},

abstract = {A general stochastic theory is presented for analysis of current records of a patch containing an arbitrary number (N) of independent homologous channels in the steady-state. We give the "basic theorem" that at the instant of any open (or shut) transition of a channel, the other N-1 channels are located in each state with a probability equal to those in the steady-state, if enough transitions are observed. Using the "basic theorem", we derived: (a) the time-dependent open and shut frequencies after a definite type of transition, and (b) the probability density functions (pdf) of the duration of any period between two successive transitions. Briefly, the main results obtained were: (1) The time-dependent open (or shut) transition frequency after every shut (or open) transition at t = 0 in an N-channel patch, fJSh,Op(t)(N) (or fJOp,Sh(t)(N)), is the same as that of a one-channel patch except for the value of the constant. (2) In the all-shut (or all-open) period of a patch, the average duration of the period is 1/N, and the slowest exponential decay constant contained in the pdf is N times those of a single channel patch, respectively. (3) An example calculation for small N showed that the stochastic properties of a single channel can be obtained even when N is uncertain, if the channel open probability is small and exponential decay constants are separated. (4) When the channels are in equilibrium, the pdf of duration of every type of period in the patch is described by a sum of exponential terms with positive coefficients. This also holds for fJSh,Op(t)(N) and fJOp,Sh(t)(N).},

abstract = {The notion of identifiability addresses the question of whether it is at all possible to obtain unique solutions for unknown parameters of interest in a mathematical model, from data collected in well-defined stimulus-response experiments performed on a dynamic system represented by the model. This critical aspect of the modeling and data reduction problem is reviewed, analyzed, and unified, with emphasis on applications in biology. Several physiological system models are examined in detail. They illustrate the importance of identifiability analysis prior to performing a parameter estimation experiment, the algebraic difficulties, possible pitfalls, and not-so-apparent ambiguities that may be encountered--even for simple models--and the utility of the concept in experiment design. Methods for testing for identifiability also are reviewed and compared, with emphasis on applicability and limitations. The usefulness of a given model for predicting the time course of system variables (not parameters) of interest normally inaccessible to direct measurement (e.g., tissue concentrations), a common use for quantitative models, is shown to depend intimately on the identifiability properties of the model, in a manner not easy but essential to assess: state variable predictions made in this manner can be inherently ambiguous.},

abstract = {1. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the NR1a-NMDA epsilon 1[NR2A] subunit combination of the NMDA receptor. Single channel behaviour was recorded from outside-out membrane patches, with the aim of comparing the results with those, recorded under the same conditions, from Xenopus oocytes injected with messenger RNA coding for the NR1a-NR2A combination. 2. Single channels in HEK 293 cells showed a main conductance level of 51.4 +/- 2.4 pS, compared with 50.1 +/- 1.4 pS for channels in oocytes. A subconductance level of 38.1 +/- 2.1 pS was found in HEK 293 cells, compared with 38.3 +/- 1.3 pS in oocytes. The frequencies of transitions between the shut and the two conductance levels were also very similar. 3. Distributions of shut times could be fitted with five exponential components. In HEK 293 cells the first three of these components had time constants of 39 +/- 4 microseconds, 0.54 +/- 0.04 ms and 9.94 +/- 1.3 ms; in oocytes the values were 69 +/- 35 microseconds, 0.54 +/- 0.15 ms and 6.53 +/- 4.6 ms, respectively. The relative areas of the components were also similar in the two systems. 4. The distribution of all apparent open times for the sublevels was fitted with two exponential components giving time constants of 0.18 +/- 0.02 ms and 1.31 +/- 0.17 ms (for HEK cells) or of 0.31 +/- 0.36 ms and 1.31 +/- 1.1 ms (for oocytes).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {New cerebral monitoring techniques allow direct measurement of brain oxygenation and metabolism. Investigation using these new tools has provided additional insight into the understanding of the pathophysiology of acute brain injury and suggested new ways to guide management of secondary brain injury. Studies of focal brain tissue oxygen monitoring have suggested ischemic thresholds in focal regions of brain injury and demonstrated the interrelationship between brain tissue oxygen tension (P bt O 2 ) and other cerebral physiologic and metabolic parameters. Jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjVO 2 ) monitoring may evaluate global brain oxygen delivery and consumption, providing thresholds for detecting brain hypoperfusion and hyperperfusion. Furthermore, critically low values of P bt O 2 and SjVO 2 have also been predictive of mortality and worsened functional outcome, especially after head trauma. Cerebral microdialysis measures the concentrations of extracellular metabolites which may be relevant to cerebral metabolism or ischemia in focal areas of injury. Cerebral blood flow may be measured in the neurointensive care unit using continuous methods such as thermal diffusion and laser Doppler flowmetry. Initial studies have also attempted to correlate findings from advanced neuromonitoring with neuroimaging using dynamic perfusion computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and Xenon computed tomography. Additionally, new methods of data acquisition, storage, and analysis are being developed to address the increasing burden of patient data from neuromonitoring. Advanced informatics techniques such as hierarchical data clustering, generalized linear models, and heat map dendrograms are now being applied to multivariable patient data in order to better develop physiologic patient profiles to improve diagnosis and treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Parameter estimation in biological models is a common yet challenging problem. In this work we explore the problem for gene regulatory networks modeled by differential equations with unknown parameters, such as decay rates, reaction rates, Michaelis-Menten constants, and Hill coefficients. We explore the question to what extent parameters can be efficiently estimated by appropriate experimental selection.

RESULTS:A minimization formulation is used to find the parameter values that best fit the experiment data. When the data is insufficient, the minimization problem often has many local minima that fit the data reasonably well. We show that selecting a new experiment based on the local Fisher Information of one local minimum generates additional data that allows one to successfully discriminate among the many local minima. The parameters can be estimated to high accuracy by iteratively performing minimization and experiment selection. We show that the experiment choices are roughly independent of which local minima is used to calculate the local Fisher Information.

CONCLUSIONS:We show that by an appropriate choice of experiments, one can, in principle, efficiently and accurately estimate all the parameters of gene regulatory network. In addition, we demonstrate that appropriate experiment selection can also allow one to restrict model predictions without constraining the parameters using many fewer experiments. We suggest that predicting model behaviors and inferring parameters represent two different approaches to model calibration with different requirements on data and experimental cost.},

abstract = {Concepts of distributed robustness and r-robustness proposed by biologists to explain a variety of stability phenomena in molecular biology are analysed. Then, the robustness of the relaxation time using a chemical reaction description of genetic and signalling networks is discussed. First, the following result for linear networks is obtained: for large multiscale systems with hierarchical distribution of time scales, the variance of the inverse relaxation time (as well as the variance of the stationary rate) is much lower than the variance of the separate constants. Moreover, it can tend to 0 faster than 1/n, where n is the number of reactions. Similar phenomena are valid in the nonlinear case as well. As a numerical illustration, a model of signalling network is used for the important transcription factor NFkappaB.},

abstract = {Organotypic culture of embryonic rat lumbar spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia has been used to demonstrate an inhibitory effect of ventral spinal cord on neurite growth from dorsal root ganglion explants. When dorsal root ganglion explants from 14-15 day old embryos were cultured alone or in close proximity to a dorsal cord explant, the pattern of dorsal root ganglion neurite outgrowth was typically radial. However, when E14-15 dorsal root ganglion explants were cocultured for 22-24 hours in proximity to a ventral spinal cord explant from the same embryo, few, if any, dorsal root ganglion neurites grew in the direction of the ventral cord explant. This inhibitory effect appeared to be developmentally regulated; it was diminished or absent in cocultures prepared from 18 day old embryos. In contrast, in cocultures of dorsal cord and ventral cord explants from E14-15 embryos, dorsal cord neurites grew abundantly toward the ventral cord explant suggesting that the inhibition is not likely to be due to a nonspecific neurotoxic effect and that the activity responsible selectively inhibits dorsal root ganglion neurite outgrowth. We conclude that a diffusible, primary afferent inhibitory factor(s) produced by embryonic ventral horn may be responsible for the inhibition. Our results are discussed with respect to the possible involvement of inhibition in the normal development of primary afferent innervation of the spinal cord.},

One emerging class of pH-detecting receptors is that of the acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs). Advances in ASIC research have improved the understanding of the role played by pH dynamics in physiological and pathophysiological processes. Increasing evidence suggests that targeting ASICs with pharmacological agents may offer an effective and novel approach for treating pain and diseases of the CNS. However, the development of pharmaceuticals that target ASICs and are suitable for clinical use remains an obstacle. This review provides an update on ASICs and their potential for therapeutic modification in pain and CNS diseases.},

abstract = {OBJECT:An intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor, from which cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is estimated, is recommended in the care of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Nevertheless, optimal ICP and CPP management may not always prevent cerebral ischemia, which adversely influences patient outcome. The authors therefore determined whether the addition of a brain tissue oxygen tension (PO2) monitor in the treatment of TBI was associated with an improved patient outcome.

METHODS:Patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] score < 8) who had been admitted to a Level I trauma center were evaluated as part of a prospective observational database. Patients treated with ICP and brain tissue PO2 monitoring were compared with historical controls matched for age, pathological features, admission GCS score, and Injury Severity Score who had undergone ICP monitoring alone. Therapy in both patient groups was aimed at maintaining an ICP less than 20 mm Hg and a CPP greater than 60 mm Hg. Among patients whose brain tissue PO2 was monitored, oxygenation was maintained at levels greater than 25 mm Hg. Twenty-five patients with a mean age of 44 +/- 14 years were treated using an ICP monitor alone. Twenty-eight patients with a mean age of 38 +/- 18 years underwent brain tissue PO2-directed care. The mean daily ICP and CPP levels were similar in each group. The mortality rate in patients treated using conventional ICP and CPP management was 44%. Patients who also underwent brain tissue PO2 monitoring had a significantly reduced mortality rate of 25% (p < 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS:The use of both ICP and brain tissue PO2 monitors and therapy directed at brain tissue PO2 is associated with reduced patient death following severe TBI.},

abstract = {We describe voltage-switching mode scanning electrochemical microscopy (VSM-SECM), in which a single SECM tip electrode was used to acquire high-quality topographical and electrochemical images of living cells simultaneously. This was achieved by switching the applied voltage so as to change the faradaic current from a hindered diffusion feedback signal (for distance control and topographical imaging) to the electrochemical flux measurement of interest. This imaging method is robust, and a single nanoscale SECM electrode, which is simple to produce, is used for both topography and activity measurements. In order to minimize the delay at voltage switching, we used pyrolytic carbon nanoelectrodes with 6.5-100~nm radii that rapidly reached a steady-state current, typically in less than 20~ms for the largest electrodes and faster for smaller electrodes. In addition, these carbon nanoelectrodes are suitable for convoluted cell topography imaging because the RG value (ratio of overall probe diameter to active electrode diameter) is typically in the range of 1.5-3.0. We first evaluated the resolution of constant-current mode topography imaging using carbon nanoelectrodes. Next, we performed VSM-SECM measurements to visualize membrane proteins on A431 cells and to detect neurotransmitters from a PC12 cells. We also combined VSM-SECM with surface confocal microscopy to allow simultaneous fluorescence and topographical imaging. VSM-SECM opens up new opportunities in nanoscale chemical mapping at interfaces, and should find wide application in the physical and biological sciences.},

abstract = {Cerebellar macroneurons, including Purkinje cells, survive and differentiate in long-term monolayer cultures, which are prepared by a partial dissociation procedure we refer to as a microexplant technique. Intracellular recording demonstrated that these neurons were functional, showing spontaneous spiking activity and electrical excitability, and both spontaneous and evoked synaptic activity. In order to further characterize cell types, light and electron microscopic studies were performed after intracellular iontophoresis of horseradish peroxidase. Purkinje neurons were identified by their form of dendritic arborization and numerous dendritic spines. Cortical granule cells and macroneurons derived from the deep nuclei could also be demonstrated.},

abstract = {1. The ion selectivity of a membrane ion conductance that is inactivated by extracellular calcium (Ca2+o) in Xenopus oocytes has been studied using the voltage-clamp technique. 2. The reversal potential of the Ca2+o-sensitive current (Ic) was measured using voltage ramps (-80 to +40 mV) as a function of the external concentration (12-240 mM) of NaCl or KCl. The direction and amplitude of the shifts in reversal potentials are consistent with permeability ratios of 1:0.99:0.24 for K+:Na+:Cl-. 3. Current-voltage (I-V ) relations of Ic, determined during either voltage ramps of 0.5 s duration or at steady state, displayed pronounced rectification at both hyperpolarized and depolarized potentials. However, instantaneous I-V relations showed less rectification and could be fitted by the constant field equation assuming the above K+:Na+:Cl- permeability ratios. 4. Ion substitution experiments indicated that relatively large organic monovalent cations and anions are permeant through Ic channels with the permeability ratios K+:NMDG+:TEA+:TPA+:TBA+:Gluc- = 1:0.45:0. 35:0.2:0.2:0.2. 5. External amiloride (200 microM), gentamicin (220 microM), flufenamic acid (40 microM), niflumic acid (100 microM), Gd3+ (0.3 microM) or Ca2+ (200 microM) caused reversible block of Ic without changing its reversal potential. 6. Preinjection of oocytes with antisense oligonucleotide against connexin 38, the Xenopus hemi-gap-junctional protein, inhibited Ic by 80 % without affecting its ion selectivity, thus confirming and extending the recent suggestion of Ebihara that Ic represents current carried through hemi-gap-junctional channels. 7. In vitro and in vivo maturation of oocytes resulted in a significant decrease in Ic conductance to 7 % and 2 % of control values, respectively. This developmental downregulation of Ic minimizes any toxic effect Ic activation would have when the mature egg is released into Ca2+o-free pond water. 8. The results of this study are discussed in relation to other Ca2+o-inactivated conductances seen in a wide variety of cell types and which have previously been interpreted as arising either from Ca2+o-masked channels or from changes in the ion selectivity of voltage-gated Ca2+ or K+ channels.},

abstract = {We have developed a computational model to simulate hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) in the neonatal piglet brain. It has been extended from a previous model by adding the simulation of carotid artery occlusion and including pH changes in the cytoplasm. Here, simulations from the model are compared with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements from two piglets during HI and short-term recovery. One of these piglets showed incomplete recovery after HI, and this is modelled by considering some of the cells to be dead. This is consistent with the results from MRS and the redox state of cytochrome-c-oxidase as measured by NIRS. However, the simulations do not match the NIRS haemoglobin measurements. The model therefore predicts that further physiological changes must also be taking place if the hypothesis of dead cells is correct.},

abstract = {The use of the electrical circuit simulation program SPICE2 for performing digital computer simulations of linear and non-linear pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models is described. SPICE2 utilizes the principles of network thermodynamics (thermodynamics of electrical circuits). These principles dictate analogy between the conservation laws of chemical reactions and mass transport and Kirchhoff's laws of current and voltage balance, and also prove that Fick's law of diffusion is isomorphous with the conductance form of Ohm's law. Detailed descriptions of program inputs, formats, and options for simulation of linear and non-linear pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic systems are provided, with appropriate examples. Single as well as multiple dose simulations (accumulation kinetics and dynamics) are discussed. The advantages of SPICE2 over other available simulation packages, including user-friendliness, ease of operation, versatility, power, and the economy of time and effort afforded, are emphasized. The educational value of SPICE2 as a highly versatile tool for teaching both fundamental and complex pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic concepts, as well as its routine usage in elucidating complex research problems, are also discussed.},

abstract = {The development of single channel recording has brought with it the need to analyse enormous amounts of data. The data analysis is time consuming and subject to observer biases since the events are random in time and are contaminated with uncorrelated noise. We have developed a heuristic pattern recognition program which identifies with high precision single channel currents and rejects contaminating noise. The program interactively provides for a variety of amplitude and duration measures. Analysis is flexible and rapid: a file containing over 10,000 events can be analysed in under 2 h. Specific detection features include variable lowpass filtering, automatic baseline restoration, and adaptive amplitude thresholds. A record is analysed through duration histograms, binomial estimates of the number of active channels present, cross-correlation estimates between parameters, spectral analysis of events and background noise, and stationarity of mean channel current. The graphic output facilities can plot raw data (after filtering and baseline restoration) with the idealized signal superimposed or with detected events underlined. A batch processing facility has been included to allow processing of data during periods of low computer demand.},

abstract = {1. Spinal cord and hippocampal neurones in cell culture were voltage clamped using the tight-seal, whole-cell recording technique. The concentration of sodium and a series of divalent cations in the extracellular media was varied to study permeation through excitatory amino acid receptor channels activated by the selective agonists N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), kainic acid and quisqualic acid. 2. On raising the extracellular calcium concentration, with [Na+]o held constant at 105 mM, the reversal potential of responses to NMDA shifted in the depolarizing direction. This shift was adequately described by the extended constant-field equation over the range 0.3-50 mM-calcium. Using ionic activity coefficients we calculate a value of PCa/PNa = 10.6. Under the same experimental conditions the reversal potential of responses to kainic and quisqualic acids was much less affected by raising the calcium concentration, such that PCa/PNa = 0.15. A depolarizing shift of the NMDA reversal potential was also recorded during application of 20 mM-barium, strontium or manganese, suggesting permeation of these ions. The permeability sequence was Ca2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Sr2+ much greater than Mn2+. No depolarizing shift of the NMDA reversal potential occurred during application of 20 mM-cobalt, magnesium or nickel. 3. In experiments in which the extracellular Na+ concentration was varied the extended constant-field equation was adequate in predicting shifts of the NMDA reversal potential recorded on varying [Na+]o over the range 50-150 mM, but failed to accurately predict the reversal potential of responses to NMDA with 10 mM-[Ca2+]o and only 10 or 20 mM-[Na+]o. These results imply an apparent increase in PCa/PNa on lowering [Na+]o and may result from interaction of permeant ions within the channel. 4. Barium and to a lesser extent calcium, but not strontium (all 20 mM), reduced the slope conductance of responses to NMDA recorded within +/- 15 mV of the reversal potential; over this limited range of membrane potential the current-voltage relationship remained linear in the presence of each of these ions. In contrast manganese produced a strong, voltage-dependent block of responses to NMDA, similar to that produced by magnesium, such that even close to the reversal potential the NMDA current-voltage relationship was highly non-linear. Thus manganese both permeates and blocks the NMDA receptor channel. 5. Raising the extracellular calcium concentration, from 0.1 to 5 mM, had two effects on the conductance mechanism activated by NMDA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Three nicotinic agonists, suberyldicholine, acetylcholine and carbachol, have been investigated by single channel recording at the endplates of adult frog muscle fibres. All three agonists can block the channels that they open. Suberyldicholine is the most potent blocker; it has an equilibrium constant for binding to the open channel of about 6 microM and blockages last for about 5 ms on average, at -105 mV. A plot of the mean number of blockages per unit open time against concentration ('blockage frequency plot') suggests that suberyldicholine does not produce long-lived blocked states such as might occur, for example, if it could be trapped within a shut channel. The characteristics of the 'blockage frequency plot' are analysed in Appendix 2. Block by acetylcholine and carbachol has much lower affinity (the equilibrium constants being a few millimolar for both), and blockages are much briefer, so that blockage appears to produce noisy single channel currents of reduced amplitude. A method based on the spectral density of the excess 'open' channel noise has been used to investigate the rate of blocking and unblocking. The basis of this method is discussed in Appendix 1. It is estimated that the mean duration of a blockage is about 18 microseconds for acetylcholine and 9 microseconds for carbachol.},

abstract = {A windkessel model is widely used to operationalize vascular characteristics. In this paper, we employ a noniterative subspace model identification (SMI) algorithm to estimate parameters in a three- and four-element windkessel model by application of physical foreknowledge. Simulation data of the systemic circulation were used to investigate systematic and random errors in the parameter estimations. Results were compared with different methods as proposed in the literature: one closed-loop and two iterative methods for the three-element model, and one iterative method for the four-element model. For the three-element model, no significant systematic errors were observed using SMI. Concerning random errors, SMI appeared more robust in parameter estimations compared with the other methods (P < 0.05 for a signal-to-noise ratio of 18 dB). For the four-element model, a significant systematic error in the estimate of the arterial inertance L was observed (P = 0.011). However, for all methods, an increasing number of outliers in parameter estimates were observed at increased noise levels. These outliers were almost exclusive due to errors in estimates of L. In conclusion, with SMI physical parameters can mathematically be derived by application of physiological foreknowledge. For a three-element windkessel model, SMI appeared a very robust method to estimate parameters. However, application to a four-element windkessel model was less accurate because of low identifiability of L. Therefore, based on the simulation results, the use of the four-element windkessel model is questionable.},

abstract = {Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) can be applied to extract single channel kinetics at signal-to-noise ratios that are too low for conventional analysis. There are two general HMM approaches: traditional Baum's reestimation and direct optimization. The optimization approach has the advantage that it optimizes the rate constants directly. This allows setting constraints on the rate constants, fitting multiple data sets across different experimental conditions, and handling nonstationary channels where the starting probability of the channel depends on the unknown kinetics. We present here an extension of this approach that addresses the additional issues of low-pass filtering and correlated noise. The filtering is modeled using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter applied to the underlying signal, and the noise correlation is accounted for using an autoregressive (AR) process. In addition to correlated background noise, the algorithm allows for excess open channel noise that can be white or correlated. To maximize the efficiency of the algorithm, we derive the analytical derivatives of the likelihood function with respect to all unknown model parameters. The search of the likelihood space is performed using a variable metric method. Extension of the algorithm to data containing multiple channels is described. Examples are presented that demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the algorithm. Practical issues such as the selection of appropriate noise AR orders are also discussed through examples.},

abstract = {In physics, Feynman diagrams are used to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quantum physics and topology: namely, a linear operator behaves very much like a "cobordism". Similar diagrams can be used to reason about logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they represent programs. With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. In this expository paper, we make some of these analogies precise using the concept of "closed symmetric monoidal category". We assume no prior knowledge of category theory, proof theory or computer science.

abstract = {Rapid and reliable detection of randomly occurring small amplitude synaptic events resulting from activation of different classes of ligand-gated receptors is a difficult task. Here, we describe and characterize an amplitude threshold algorithm, written as an IGOR Pro procedure, which detects events as well as characterizes their amplitudes and kinetics. The program was developed to analyze recording traces that each contained both excitatory (glutamate-mediated) and inhibitory (GABA and glycine-mediated) events. By using differences in kinetics, the program could discriminate between the two different classes of events. In summary, the program has the following strengths: (1) it is generally applicable to circumstances in which different populations of elementary events occur concurrently, a drawback of methods that employ matched filtering techniques, (2) it is relatively insensitive to drifts in baseline, and (3) it generates user-accessible arrays of the timing, amplitude and kinetic parameters of the detected events, making customized statistical analysis of event characteristics easily executable.},

abstract = {This paper considers the classical error correcting problem which is frequently discussed in coding theory. We wish to recover an input vector $f \in \R^n$ from corrupted measurements $y = A f + e$. Here, $A$ is an $m$ by $n$ (coding) matrix and $e$ is an arbitrary and unknown vector of errors. Is it possible to recover $f$ exactly from the data $y$? We prove that under suitable conditions on the coding matrix $A$, the input $f$ is the unique solution to the $\ell_1$-minimization problem ($\|x\|_{\ell_1} := \sum_i |x_i|$) $$ \min_{g \in \R^n} \| y - Ag \|_{\ell_1} $$ provided that the support of the vector of errors is not too large, $\|e\|_{\ell_0} := |\{i : e_i \neq 0\}| \le \rho \cdot m$ for some $\rho > 0$. In short, $f$ can be recovered exactly by solving a simple convex optimization problem (which one can recast as a linear program). In addition, numerical experiments suggest that this recovery procedure works unreasonably well; $f$ is recovered exactly even in situations where a significant fraction of the output is corrupted.},

abstract = {Physicists, engineers and mathematicians are accustomed to the combination of elegance, rigour and utility that characterise mathematical models. They are familiar with the need to dip into their mathematical toolbox to select the technique of choice. However, medicine and biology have not been characterised, in general, by a mathematical formalism. The relative paucity of mathematical models in biology and medicine reflects in part the difficulty in making accurate and appropriate experimental measurements in the field. Signal noise, the lack of appropriate sensors, and uncertainty as to what constitutes the significant measurements are largely to blame for this. The purpose of this paper is to characterise a 'good' model, encourage the development and application of such models to new areas, and outline future developments in the field. It is proposed that a good model will be accurate, predictive, economical, unique and elegant. These principles will be illustrated with reference to four models: radiosensitisation of tumours, modelling solute clearance in haemodialysis, the myogenic response in reactive hyperaemia and cardiac electrical activity. It is suggested that, in the immediate future, the mathematical model will become a useful adjunct to laboratory experiment (and possibly clinical trial), and the provision of 'in silico' models will become routine.},

abstract = {1. The whole-cell and outside-out configurations of the patch-clamp method were used to investigate the properties of the channels activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA channels) in mouse central neurones in culture. Recording was made in Mg2+-free solutions. 2. In the whole-cell recording mode the currents induced by both NMDA and L-glutamate were accompanied by a large increase in noise. In both cases the noise power spectra were well fitted by single Lorentzian functions and the corresponding mean time constant, tau, was about 6 ms at room temperature. The single-channel conductance, gamma n, estimated from the ratio of the noise variance to the total current, varied between 22 and 40 pS. 3. Endogenous amino acids known to activate NMDA receptors (L-glutamate, L-aspartate, L-cysteine sulphinate and quinolinate) as well as exogenous NMDA agonists such as ibotenate and trans-2,3-piperidine dicarboxylate (trans-PDA) all produced similar responses. In particular, analysis of the current noise yielded tau values between 4 and 8 ms in all cases. 4. NMDA responses were antagonized by 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) without any effect on gamma n or tau values measured by noise analysis; NMDA responses were also diminished by D-alpha-aminoadipate and cis-2,3-piperidine dicarboxylate. 5. In outside-out patches, it was observed that the single-channel current amplitude varies linearly as a function of membrane potential between -80 and +60 mV. The reversal potential is near 0 mV. NMDA channels are permeable to Na+, K+ and Cs+, but blocked by choline. The single-channel conductance, gamma e, varies between 40 and 50 pS at room temperature. 6. The NMDA channels open in bursts of short openings interrupted by brief closures. At -60 mV, the closures had a mean duration, tc, of 0.4 +/- 0.2 ms. The mean channel open time, to, was 5.9 +/- 1.0 ms for NMDA and 5.3 +/- 1.7 ms for L-glutamate. The mean burst duration, tb, was 10.5 +/- 0.7 ms for NMDA and 8.5 +/- 2.0 ms for L-glutamate. 7. When the temperature was increased between 14 and 24 degrees C, the NMDA channel conductance increased with a Q10 of 1.6 while the mean open time decreased with a Q10 close to 2. 8. The NMDA channel showed, in addition to the 'main' conductance state (40-50 pS), smaller conductance states of 15 and 35 pS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Using the novel mathematical technique known as wavelet analysis, a new method (WSC) is presented to sort spikes according to a decomposition of neural signals in the time-frequency space. The WSC method is implemented by a pyramidal algorithm that acts upon neural signals as a bank of quadrature mirror filters. This algorithm is clearly explained and an overview of the mathematical background of wavelet analysis is given. An artificial spike train, especially designed to test the specificity and sensibility of sorting procedures, was used to assess the performance of the WSC method as well as of methods based on principal component analysis (PCA) and reduced feature set (RFS). The WSC method outperformed the other two methods. Its superior performance was largely due to the fact that spike profiles that could not be separated by previous methods (because of the similarity of their temporal profile and the masking action of noise) were separable by the WSC method. The WSC method is particularly noise resistant, as it implicitly eliminates the irrelevant information contained in the noise frequency range. But the main advantage of the WSC method is its use of parameters that describe the joint time-frequency localization of spike features to build a fast and unspecialized pattern recognition procedure.},

abstract = {1. The activation of GABAA receptors in nerve terminal membranes gates a Cl- channel. Experiments were conducted to determine how the activation of this receptor influences membrane potentials, action potentials and voltage-activated Na+ and K+ channels. 2. When activation of the GABAA receptor produced only conductance changes and no voltage changes, action potentials changed only slightly. The threshold for action potential generation increased by 15%. GABA reduced the broadening of action potentials caused by high frequency stimulation by only 7%. These results indicate that membrane shunting by GABA-gated Cl- channels plays a relatively minor role. 3. By recording changes in the current through K+ channels in cell-attached patches, the activation of GABAA receptors was shown to depolarize the nerve terminal membrane from rest by 14 mV. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen produced no change in resting membrane potential as measured by this same technique. 4. In whole-terminal recordings under current clamp, with pipettes containing various Cl- concentrations, the GABA-induced depolarization increased with Ecl. The variation with Ecl provided a basis for evaluating the contributions of leak and K+ current in the balance of currents that determines the magnitude of the GABA-induced depolarization. 5. Based on the GABA-induced voltage change and an evaluation of the other currents of significance in the relevant voltage range, an estimate was obtained for ECl of -48 mV to give an estimate for the intracellular Cl- ion concentration of 20 mM. 6. Under conditions allowing both conductance and voltage to change during Cl- channel gating, GABA prevented action potential responses to current injection. Comparable depolarizations produced by adjusting a steady holding current also blocked action potential responses. 7. A depolarization from -60 to -45 mV under voltage clamp inactivated approximately 90% of the Na+ channels and activated a small amount of K+ current. This suggests that inactivation of Na+ channels makes a major contribution to the inhibition of action potentials by GABA. 8. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that GABA inhibits neurosecretion by retarding impulse propagation into the terminal arborization. These results support a depolarization block mechanism for the inhibition of secretion, in which depolarization inactivates Na+ channels sufficiently to block action potentials.},

Based on a newly designed set-up on top of an inverted light microscope in combination with a speed optimized low noise intracellular amplifier, a novel mode for control of the distance between the probe and surface has been developed. By application of current pulses, the change in the resistance is monitored independently from electrode drift and parasitic DC currents. We demonstrate the applicability by showing first high-resolution images of neural cells produced with the pulse-mode operated SICM.},

abstract = {Fluorescence imaging of two independently labelled proteins is commonly used to determine their co-localization in cells. Antibody-mediated crosslinking can mediate the patching of such proteins at the cell surface, and their co-localization can serve to determine complex formation among them. However, manual analysis of such studies is both tedious and subjective. Here we present a digital co-localization analysis that is independent of the fluorescence intensity, is highly consistent and reproducible between observers, and dramatically reduces the analysis time. The approach presented is based on a segmentation procedure that creates binary objects, and then determines whether objects belonging to two different groups (e.g. green- and red-labelled) are co-localized. Two methods are used to determine co-localization. The 'overlap' analysis defines two objects as co-localized if the centre of mass of one falls within the area of the other. The 'nearest-neighbour distance' analysis considers two objects as co-localized if their centres are within a threshold distance determined by the imaging modality. To test the significance of the results, the analysis of the actual images is tested against randomized images generated by a method that creates images with uncorrelated distributions of objects from the two groups. The applicability of the algorithms presented to study protein interactions in live cells is demonstrated by co-patching studies on influenza haemagglutinin mutants that do or do not associate into mutual oligomers at the cell surface via binding to AP-2 adaptor complexes. The approach presented is potentially applicable to studies of co-localization by other methods (e.g. electron microscopy), and the nearest-neighbour distance method can also be adapted to study phenomena of correlated placement.},

abstract = {A quantitative estimate of cerebral blood oxygen saturation is of critical importance in the investigation of cerebrovascular disease because of the fact that it could potentially provide information on tissue viability in vivo. In the current study, a multi-echo gradient and spin echo magnetic resonance imaging sequence was used to acquire images from eight normal volunteer subjects. All images were acquired on a Siemens 1.5T Symphony whole-body scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). A theoretical signal model, which describes the signal dephasing phenomena in the presence of deoxyhemoglobin, was used for postprocessing of the acquired images and obtaining a quantitative measurement of cerebral blood oxygen saturation in vivo. With a region-of-interest analysis, a mean cerebral blood oxygen saturation of 58.4%+/-1.8% was obtained in the brain parenchyma from all volunteers. It is in excellent agreement with the known cerebral blood oxygen saturation under normal physiologic conditions in humans. Although further studies are needed to overcome some of the confounding factors affecting the estimates of cerebral blood oxygen saturation, these preliminary results are encouraging and should open a new avenue for the noninvasive investigation of cerebral oxygen metabolism under different pathophysiologic conditions using a magnetic resonance imaging approach.},

abstract = {To understand the processes underlying fast synaptic transmission in the mammalian CNS, we must have detailed knowledge of the identity, location, and physiology of the ion channels in the neuronal membrane. From labeling studies we can get clues regarding the distribution of ion channels, but electrophysiological methods are required to determine the importance of each ion channel in CNS transmission. Dendrotoxin-sensitive potassium channel subunits are highly concentrated in cerebellar basket cell nerve terminals, and we have previously shown that they are responsible for a significant fraction of the voltage-gated potassium current in this region. Here, we further investigate the characteristics and pharmacology of the voltage-dependent potassium currents in these inhibitory nerve terminals and compare these observations with those obtained from somatic recordings in basket and Purkinje cell soma regions. We find that alpha-DTX blocks basket cell nerve terminal currents and not somatic currents, and the IC(50) for alpha-DTX in basket cell terminals is 3.2 nM. There are at least two distinct types of potassium currents in the nerve terminal, a DTX-sensitive low-threshold component, and a second component that activates at much more positive voltages. Pharmacological experiments also reveal that nerve terminal potassium currents are also markedly reduced by 4-AP and TEA, with both high-sensitivity (micromolar) and low-sensitivity (millimolar) components present. We suggest that basket cell nerve terminals have potassium channels from both the Kv1 and Kv3 subfamilies, whereas somatic currents in basket cell and Purkinje cell bodies are more homogeneous.},

abstract = {Although the dynamics of cell membranes and associated structures is vital for cell function, little is known due to lack of suitable methods. We found, using scanning ion conductance microscopy, that microvilli, membrane projections supported by internal actin bundles, undergo a life cycle: fast height-dependent growth, relatively short steady state, and slow height-independent retraction. The microvilli can aggregate into relatively stable structures where the steady state is extended. We suggest that the intrinsic dynamics of microvilli, combined with their ability to make stable structures, allows them to act as elementary "building blocks" for the assembly of specialized structures on the cell surface.},

We have pioneered the application of a form of scanning probe microscopy based on a scanned nanopipette, originally developed by Hansma and co-workers, for reliable non-contact imaging over the surface of a live cell. We have found that the nanopipette can also be used for controlled local voltage-driven application of reagents or biomolecules and this can be used for controlled deposition and the local delivery of probes for mapping of specific species. In this article we review this progress, focussing on the physical principles and new phenomena that we have observed, and then outline the future applications that are now possible.},

abstract = {We present here a maximal likelihood algorithm for estimating single-channel kinetic parameters from idealized patch-clamp data. The algorithm takes into account missed events caused by limited time resolution of the recording system. Assuming a fixed dead time, we derive an explicit expression for the corrected transition rate matrix by generalizing the theory of Roux and Sauve (1985, Biophys. J. 48:149-158) to the case of multiple conductance levels. We use a variable metric optimizer with analytical derivatives for rapidly maximizing the likelihood. The algorithm is applicable to data containing substates and multiple identical or nonidentical channels. It allows multiple data sets obtained under different experimental conditions, e.g., concentration, voltage, and force, to be fit simultaneously. It also permits a variety of constraints on rate constants and provides standard errors for all estimates of model parameters. The algorithm has been tested extensively on a variety of kinetic models with both simulated and experimental data. It is very efficient and robust; rate constants for a multistate model can often be extracted in a processing time of approximately 1 min, largely independent of the starting values.},

abstract = {Entropy, as it relates to dynamical systems, is the rate of information production. Methods for estimation of the entropy of a system represented by a time series are not, however, well suited to analysis of the short and noisy data sets encountered in cardiovascular and other biological studies. Pincus introduced approximate entropy (ApEn), a set of measures of system complexity closely related to entropy, which is easily applied to clinical cardiovascular and other time series. ApEn statistics, however, lead to inconsistent results. We have developed a new and related complexity measure, sample entropy (SampEn), and have compared ApEn and SampEn by using them to analyze sets of random numbers with known probabilistic character. We have also evaluated cross-ApEn and cross-SampEn, which use cardiovascular data sets to measure the similarity of two distinct time series. SampEn agreed with theory much more closely than ApEn over a broad range of conditions. The improved accuracy of SampEn statistics should make them useful in the study of experimental clinical cardiovascular and other biological time series.},

abstract = {In the last decade the study of the human brain and muscle energetics underwent a radical change, thanks to the progressive introduction of noninvasive techniques, including near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (NIRS). This review summarizes the most recent literature about the principles, techniques, advantages, limitations, and applications of NIRS in exercise physiology and neuroscience. The main NIRS instrumentations and measurable parameters will be reported. NIR light (700-1000 m) penetrates superficial layers (skin, subcutaneous fat, skull, etc.) and is either absorbed by chromophores (oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and myoglobin) or scattered within the tissue. NIRS is a noninvasive and relatively low-cost optical technique that is becoming a widely used instrument for measuring tissue O2 saturation, changes in hemoglobin volume and, indirectly, brain/muscle blood flow and muscle O2 consumption. Tissue O2 saturation represents a dynamic balance between O2 supply and O2 consumption in the small vessels such as the capillary, arteriolar, and venular bed. The possibility of measuring the cortical activation in response to different stimuli, and the changes in the cortical cytochrome oxidase redox state upon O2 delivery changes, will also be mentioned.},

abstract = {Axo-dendritic synaptogenesis was examined in live hippocampal cell cultures using the fluorescent dyes DiO to label dendrites and FM 4-64 to label functional presynaptic boutons. As the first functional synaptic boutons appeared in these cultures, numerous filopodia (up to 10 micron long) were observed to extend transiently (mean lifetime 9.5 min) from dendritic shafts. With progressively increasing numbers of boutons, there were coincident decreases in numbers of transient filopodia and increases in numbers of stable dendritic spines. Dendritic filopodia were observed to initiate physical contacts with nearby axons. This sometimes resulted in filopodial stabilization and formation of functional presynaptic boutons. These findings suggest that dendritic filopodia may actively initiate synaptogenic contacts with nearby (5-10 micron) axons and thereafter evolve into dendritic spines.},

abstract = {A parameter-free method is presented for the level detection in ion channel records via recovery of step wise current changes. No assumptions about ion channel mechanism are made. The primary detection of the transitions is made by statistical filtering the data using the Student's t-test. The event currents are calculated as the average value of the current between two adjacent transitions. An optimal ideal trace is found by maximization of a likelihood function. The distribution of event currents recovered from the raw data is then analysed, again by using the Student's t-test, for their grouping into separate statistical ensembles, defining current levels. The method is subjected to rigorous test using simulated data, and is compared with several other methods. It produces the levels of channel current, their noise amplitudes and distributions of dwell times, the desired information for constructing the channel mechanism.},

abstract = {Ion channels activated by glutamate, aspartate, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) have been investigated in outside-out patches from cultured cerebellar granule neurons of the rat. Openings of these channels occur in bursts, within which the individual openings are separated by brief shuttings or gaps. The shut-time distributions obtained with each agonist were fitted with four exponential components. The briefest two components were considered as 'gaps within bursts'. Their mean time-constants were: glutamate, 58.0 microseconds and 592 microseconds; aspartate, 31.3 microseconds and 644 microseconds; NMDA, 40.5 microseconds and 903 microseconds. Distributions of burst durations were fitted with three exponential components. The mean time-constants obtained for the longest two components were: glutamate, 1.33 ms and 10.5 ms; aspartate, 2.15 ms and 10.3 ms; NMDA, 2.42 ms and 10.5 ms. Evidence is given that these two components of burst duration reflect the gating kinetics of 50 pS openings and not the fact that each agonist produces openings to more than one conductance level. Not only do openings occur in bursts, but these bursts were observed to occur in clusters, which can be hundreds of milliseconds long. We discuss the relation between the kinetics of single-channel openings observed in patches and the spectral components detected in whole-cell current noise.},

Omitting the prior leads to the standard KL-NMF algorithms as special cases, where maximum likelihood parameter estimation is carried out via the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm. Starting from this view, we develop full Bayesian inference via variational Bayes or Monte Carlo. Our construction retains conjugacy and enables us to develop more powerful models while retaining attractive features of standard NMF such as monotonic convergence and easy implementation. We illustrate our approach on model order selection and image reconstruction.},

abstract = {Persistent changes in synaptic efficacy are thought to underlie the formation of learning and memory in the brain. High-frequency activation of an afferent excitatory fibre system can induce long-term potentiation, and conjunctive activation of two distinct excitatory synaptic inputs to the cerebellar Purkinje cells can lead to long-term depression of the synaptic activity of one of the inputs. Here we report a new form of neural plasticity in which activation of an excitatory synaptic input can induce a potentiation of inhibitory synaptic signals to the same cell. In cerebellar Purkinje cells stimulation of the excitatory climbing fibre synapses is followed by a long-lasting (up to 75 min) potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (i.p.s.cs), a phenomenon that we term rebound potentiation. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in combination with fluorometric video imaging of intracellular calcium ion concentration, we find that a climbing fibre-induced transient increase in postsynaptic calcium concentration triggers the induction of rebound potentiation. Because the response of Purkinje cells to bath-applied exogenous GABA is also potentiated after climbing fibre-stimulation with a time course similar to that of the rebound potentiation of i.p.s.cs, we conclude that the potentiation is caused by a calcium-dependent upregulation of postsynaptic GABAA receptor function. We propose that rebound potentiation is a mechanism by which in vivo block of climbing fibre activity induces an increase in excitability in Purkinje cells. Moreover, rebound potentiation of i.p.s.cs is a cellular mechanism which, in addition to the long-term depression of parallel fibre synaptic activity, may have an important role for motor learning in the cerebellum.},

Here we report how pharmacologically identified Ca2+ channels behave in different neural compartments. Whole-cell and cell-attached patch-clamp recordings were made on both cell bodies and electrically isolated dendrites of sympathetic neurons. We found not only that Ca2+ channel populations differentially contribute to somatic and dendritic currents but also that families of Ca2+ channels display gating properties and neurotransmitter modulation that depend on channel compartmentalization. By comparison with their somatic counterparts, dendritic N-type Ca2+ currents were hypersensitive to neurotransmitters and G proteins. Single-channel analysis showed that dendrites express a unique N-type channel that has enhanced interaction with Gbetagamma. Thus Ca2+ channels in dendrites seem to be specialized elements with unique regulatory mechanisms.},

abstract = {Large scale nonlinear support vector machines (SVMs) can be approximated by linear ones using a suitable feature map. The linear SVMs are in general much faster to learn and evaluate (test) than the original nonlinear SVMs. This work introduces explicit feature maps for the additive class of kernels, such as the intersection, Hellinger's, and $\chi$2 kernels, commonly used in computer vision, and enables their use in large scale problems. In particular, we: 1) provide explicit feature maps for all additive homogeneous kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; 2) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on a spectral analysis; and 3) quantify the error of the approximation, showing that the error is independent of the data dimension and decays exponentially fast with the approximation order for selected kernels such as $\chi$2. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernels yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVMs. We also compare with two other approximation methods: Nystrom's approximation of Perronnin et al., which is data dependent, and the explicit map of Maji and Berg for the intersection kernel, which, as in the case of our approximations, is data independent. The approximations are evaluated on a number of standard data sets, including Caltech-101, Daimler-Chrysler pedestrians, and INRIA pedestrians.},

abstract = {A theory is presented which relates the nonstationary autocovariance (covariance) function to the kinetics of independently-gated ionic channels. The experimental covariance was calculated from ensembles of 256--504 current records elicited from single, voltage-clamped, frog myelinated nerve fibers. Analysis of the covariance shows that the decay of channels from conducting to nonconducting states proceeds more slowly late in a depolarization to near 0 mV, as compared with early in the same depolarization. This behavior is inconsistent with there being only one kinetic state corresponding to the open channel. The behavior can be explained by the existence of multiple kinetic states corresponding to the open channel, or, alternatively, by the existence of multiple, kinetically distinct populations of channels.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that the functional compartmentalization of eukaryotic cells is reflected by the differential occurrence of proteins in their compartments. The location and physiological function of a protein are closely related; local information of a protein is thus crucial to understanding its role in biological processes. The visualization of proteins residing on intracellular structures by fluorescence microscopy has become a routine approach in cell biology and is increasingly used to assess their colocalization with well-characterized markers. However, image-analysis methods for colocalization studies are a field of contention and enigma. We have therefore undertaken to review the most currently used colocalization analysis methods, introducing the basic optical concepts important for image acquisition and subsequent analysis. We provide a summary of practical tips for image acquisition and treatment that should precede proper colocalization analysis. Furthermore, we discuss the application and feasibility of colocalization tools for various biological colocalization situations and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses. We have created a novel toolbox for subcellular colocalization analysis under ImageJ, named JACoP, that integrates current global statistic methods and a novel object-based approach.},

abstract = {In the visible/NIR (600-900 nm) three different redox centres are potentially detectable in vivo in mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase: haem a (605nm), the binuclear haem a3/CuB centre (655 nm) and CuA (830 nm). In this paper we report changes in the steady state reduction of these centres following increases in the rate of electron entry into the purified enzyme complex under conditions of saturating oxygen tension. As turnover is increased all three centres becomes progressively reduced. Analysis of the steady states indicated that all three centres remained in apparent equilibrium with cytochrome c throughout the titration. The calculated redox potentials of CuA (+224 mV) and haem a (+267 mV) were consistent with previous equilibrium data. The 655 nm band was also found to be oxygen and flux sensitive. It may be a useful additional in vivo detectable chromophore. However, it titrated with an apparent redox potential of +230 mV, far from its equilibrium value (+400 mV). The implications of these results for the interpretation of non invasive measurements of mitochondrial function are discussed.},

abstract = {OBJECT:Intracerebral microdialysis has attracted increasing interest as a monitoring technique during neurological/neurosurgical intensive care. The purpose of this study was to compare cerebral energy metabolism, an indicator of secondary excitotoxic injury and cell membrane degradation close to focal traumatic lesions ("penumbra zones") and in remote and apparently intact brain regions of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres.

METHODS:The study included 22 consecutive patients with a mean age 44 +/- 17 years and an estimated postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale motor score less than 5. Altogether 40 microdialysis catheters with radiopaque tips were inserted. Two catheters could not be localized on postoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans and were excluded from the analysis. The perfusates were analyzed at the patient's bedside for levels of glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glutamate, and glycerol with the aid of a CMA 600 Analyzer. The positions of eight (22%) of the 36 catheters were reclassified after a review of findings on CT scans. Except for pyruvate the values of all biochemical variables and the lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio were significantly different in the penumbra zone when compared with mean values found in "normal" tissue ipsilateral to the parenchymal damage and in contralateral normal tissue (p < 0.001). In the penumbra zone a slow normalization of the L/P ratio and levels of glutamate and glycerol were observed. In normal tissue these parameters remained within normal limits.

CONCLUSIONS:Data obtained from intracerebral microdialysis can be correctly interpreted only if the locations of the catheters as they relate to focal brain lesions are visualized. A "biochemical penumbra zone" surrounds focal traumatic brain lesions. It remains to be proven whether therapeutic interventions can protect the penumbra zone from permanent damage.},

abstract = {Stimulus reconstruction or decoding methods provide an important tool for understanding how sensory and motor information is represented in neural activity. We discuss Bayesian decoding methods based on an encoding generalized linear model (GLM) that accurately describes how stimuli are transformed into the spike trains of a group of neurons. The form of the GLM likelihood ensures that the posterior distribution over the stimuli that caused an observed set of spike trains is log concave so long as the prior is. This allows the maximum a posteriori (MAP) stimulus estimate to be obtained using efficient optimization algorithms. Unfortunately, the MAP estimate can have a relatively large average error when the posterior is highly nongaussian. Here we compare several Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that allow for the calculation of general Bayesian estimators involving posterior expectations (conditional on model parameters). An efficient version of the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm was significantly superior to other MCMC methods for gaussian priors. When the prior distribution has sharp edges and corners, on the other hand, the "hit-and-run" algorithm performed better than other MCMC methods. Using these algorithms, we show that for this latter class of priors, the posterior mean estimate can have a considerably lower average error than MAP, whereas for gaussian priors, the two estimators have roughly equal efficiency. We also address the application of MCMC methods for extracting nonmarginal properties of the posterior distribution. For example, by using MCMC to calculate the mutual information between the stimulus and response, we verify the validity of a computationally efficient Laplace approximation to this quantity for gaussian priors in a wide range of model parameters; this makes direct model-based computation of the mutual information tractable even in the case of large observed neural populations, where methods based on binning the spike train fail. Finally, we consider the effect of uncertainty in the GLM parameters on the posterior estimators.},

In nucleated patches, NMDA currents were potentiated by reductions in external osmolarity and were reduced in hyper-osmotic solutions. These changes, which were greater for low concentrations of NMDA, were not observed for responses to kainate, glycine, or GABA. They could be mimicked by directly changing the pipette pressure in nucleated, outside-out, inside-out, and cell-attached patches. Osmosensitivity of NMDA responses was also observed in the whole-cell mode, but only after prolonged dialysis. Mechanosensitivity of NMDA receptors could have an important role in neuronal regions experiencing changes in membrane tension, such as spines or growth cones.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present work was to test the hypothesis that no more than one vesicle of transmitter can be liberated by an action potential at a single release site. Spontaneous and evoked IPSCs were recorded from interneurons in the molecular layer of cerebellar slices. Evoked IPSCs were obtained using either extracellular stimulation or paired recordings of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Connections were identified as single-site synapses when evoked current amplitudes could be grouped into one peak that was well separated from the background noise. Peak amplitudes ranged from 30 to 298 pA. Reducing the release probability by lowering the external Ca2+ concentration or adding Cd2+ failed to reveal smaller quantal components. Some spontaneous IPSCs (1.4-2.4%) and IPSCs evoked at single-site synapses (2-6%) were followed within <5 msec by a secondary IPSC that could not be accounted for by random occurrence of background IPSCs. Nonlinear summation of closely timed events indicated that they involved activation of a common set of receptors and therefore that several vesicles could be released at the same release site by one action potential. An average receptor occupancy of 0.70 was calculated after single release events. At some single-site connections, two closely spaced amplitude peaks were resolved, presumably reflecting single and double vesicular release. Consistent with multivesicular release, kinetics of onset, decay, and latency were correlated to IPSC amplitude. We conclude that the one-site, one-vesicle hypothesis does not hold at interneuron-interneuron synapses.},

abstract = {Longitudinal response gradients in the microcirculation may in part be explained in terms of the length-tension relationship of vascular smooth muscle at different points along the vascular tree. To test this hypothesis, four branching orders of arterial vessels (20-80 microns ID) were dissected from the hamster cheek pouch and cannulated with concentric micropipettes. Intraluminal pressure was monitored with a servo-null micropipette, and arteriolar dimensions were measured using a videomicrometer. All arterioles developed spontaneous tone in physiological saline solution. Pressure-diameter curves were recorded for maximally activated vessels and for passive vessels. Maximal active wall tension varied nearly threefold, but maximal active medial wall stress (approximately 4 x 10(6) dyn/cm2) varied only approximately 20% between the different vessel orders. These data support the concept that smooth muscle cells from vessels of different sizes are mechanically similar but do not completely explain the longitudinal response gradients reported in the cheek pouch microcirculation. An analysis of the effect of arteriolar wall buckling suggests that the luminal folds that develop at short vessel radii may broaden the peak of the active stress-length curve and extend the pressure range over which arterioles are most sensitive to physical and chemical stimuli.},

abstract = {Cultured rat cortical astrocytes, in addition to a variety of voltage-sensitive potassium channels, also express anion channels. However, the behavior and regulation of these anion channels have been far less studied. This paper describes a patch-clamp study on a voltage-sensitive 200-300 pS high-conductance single-channel anion current, which seems to possess at least five different open sublevels or, alternatively, be formed from five or more small-conductance ion channels linked together. This channel is voltage dependent, showing a bell-shaped open probability curve with highest open probability close to the reversal potential (zero-current). Although potassium channels are commonly detected in astrocytes in cell-attached and excised patches with both normal osmolarity and hypoosmotic solutions, the occurrence of the anion channel is clearly increased in isolated patches when hypoosmotic bath solutions are used. Also, cell aging in culture and the preparation of secondary cell cultures by trypsinization seem to increase the rate of occurrence of the anion channel. Though this channel is more routinely seen when a membrane patch is excised from the cell, occasionally cell-attached configurations with instant channel activity can be formed. While the modulation of this anion channel was being studied, it was found to be blocked by an anion transport inhibitor, L-644,711, reported to affect cell volume regulation in astrocytes.},

abstract = {Acidic amino acids are putative excitatory synaptic transmitters, the ionic mechanism of which is not well understood. Recent studies with selective agonists and antagonists suggest that neurones of the mammalian central nervous system possess several different receptors for acidic amino acids, which in turn are coupled to separate conductance mechanisms. N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) is a selective agonist for one of these receptors. The excitatory action of amino acids acting at NMDA receptors is remarkably sensitive to the membrane potential and it has been suggested that the NMDA receptor is coupled to a voltage-sensitive conductance. Recently, patch-clamp experiments have shown the voltage-dependent block by Mg2+ of current flow through ion channels activated by L-glutamate. We now show using voltage-clamp experiments on mouse spinal cord neurones that the voltage-sensitivity of NMDA action is greatly reduced on the withdrawal of physiological concentrations (approximately 1 mM) of Mg2+ from the extracellular fluid. This provides further evidence that Mg2+ blocks inward current flow through ion channels linked to NMDA receptors.},

abstract = {Activity of the antioestrogen-activated maxi-Cl(-) channel has been recorded in different cell types, including fibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle, endothelial and neuroblastoma cells. Its electrophysiological properties resemble those of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) of the outer mitochondrial membrane, a channel of particular relevance to the physiology and pathophysiology of mitochondria. The hypothesis that VDAC could be the molecular correlate of the plasma membrane maxi-Cl(-) channel has been debated over the last few years, with the lack of clear evidence for the presence of VDAC in the plasma membrane constituting the main argument of the detractors. In the present study, we investigated the cellular localisation of VDAC in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. The presence of a plasma membrane VDAC was demonstrated by immunoblotting of membrane fractions with monoclonal antibodies against the VDAC and by RT-PCR using primers that hybridise to a VDAC sequence coding for a N-terminal leader peptide required for its plasma membrane sorting. In addition, confocal microscopy studies showed the colocalisation of VDAC with caveolin-1. As expected, VDAC also localised to mitochondria. Colocalisation studies with TOM-20, a protein also present in the outer mitochondrial membrane, showed that VDAC proteins localised only to peripheral and not to perinuclear mitochondria.},

abstract = {Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or cluster analysis is notoriously difficult, especially for high-dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high-dimensional) selection algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularisation for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied. We prove for randomised Lasso that stability selection will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions needed for consistency of the original Lasso method are violated. We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

abstract = {Na+ and K+ channel localization and clustering are essential for proper electrical signal generation and transmission in CNS myelinated nerve fibres. In particular, Na+ channels are clustered at high density at nodes of Ranvier, and Shaker-type K+ channels are sequestered in juxtaparanodal zones, just beyond the paranodal axoglial junctions. The mechanisms of channel localization at nodes of Ranvier in the CNS during development in both normal and hypomyelinating mutant animals are discussed and reviewed. As myelination proceeds, Na+ channels are initially found in broad zones within gaps between neighbouring oligodendroglial processes, and then are condensed into focal clusters. This process appears to depend on the formation of axoglial junctions. K+ channels are first detected in juxtaparanodal zones, and in mutant mice lacking normal axoglial junctions, these channels fail to cluster. In these mice, despite the presence of numerous oligodendrocytes, Na+ channel clusters are rare, and when present, are highly irregular. A number of molecules have recently been described that are candidates for a role in the neuron-glial interactions driving ion channel clustering. This paper reviews the cellular and molecular events responsible for formation of the mature node of Ranvier in the CNS.},

abstract = {Brain injury results from ischemia, tissue hypoxia, and a cascade of secondary events. The cornerstone of neurocritical care management is optimization and maintenance of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen and substrate delivery to prevent or attenuate this secondary damage. New techniques for monitoring brain tissue oxygen tension (PtiO2) are now available. Brain PtiO2 reflects both oxygen delivery and consumption. Brain hypoxia (low brain PtiO2) has been associated with poor outcomes in patients with brain injury. Strategies to improve brain PtiO2 have focused mainly on increasing oxygen delivery either by increasing CBF or by increasing arterial oxygen content. The results of nonrandomized studies comparing brain PtiO2-guided therapy with intracranial pressure/cerebral perfusion pressure-guided therapy, while promising, have been mixed. More studies are needed including prospective, randomized controlled trials to assess the true value of this approach. The following is a review of the physiology of brain tissue oxygenation, the effect of brain hypoxia on outcome, strategies to increase oxygen delivery, and outcome studies of brain PtiO2-guided therapy in neurocritical care.},

abstract = {In the cerebellum, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors play an important role in neuronal differentiation and excitatory synaptic transmission. During early cerebellar development, marked changes occur in the distribution of messenger RNAs encoding various NMDA-receptor subunits. To determine whether these changes result in the appearance of functionally distinct NMDA receptors, we have recorded single-channel currents in rat cerebellar granule cells during the period of their migration from the external germinal layer to the inner granular layer. Here we show that before synapse formation, pre-migratory and migrating granule cells express NMDA receptors possessing single-channel properties similar to those previously described for many central neurons. In contrast, mature post-migratory cells also express an atypical form of NMDA receptor that has a lower single-channel conductance and distinct kinetic behaviour. The properties of these 'low-conductance' channels correspond to those described for recombinant NMDA receptors formed by coexpression of NR1 and NR2C subunits. The NR2C subunit appears postnatally and is found predominantly in the adult cerebellum. Our data demonstrate developmental changes in NMDA-receptor properties at the single-channel level, and suggest that in the cerebellum the expression of a specific subunit protein results in a distinct form of native receptor.},

abstract = {We observed Na, K, and Cl voltage-dependent currents in a patch-clamp study of mouse brain astrocytes. In whole-cell recordings, depolarizations activated inward currents that were identified as Na currents since they were blocked by TTX, although complete block required high concentrations (greater than 1 microM). The corresponding single-channel Na currents were observed in outside-out patches. The channels were opened by a depolarizing pulse applied from a holding potential identical to the resting potential (-70 to -80 mV). Therefore, they may be considered functional Na channels. After addition of veratridine and an alpha-scorpion toxin, the decay of Na currents in whole-cell recordings was slower than observed under control conditions. At the single-channel level, the channels appeared to open in bursts. Depolarization did not increase the duration of the bursts, but inside each burst, increased the time spent in the open state. The K currents observed in the whole-cell recording mode were separated into inactivating and noninactivating currents. The inactivating current resembled the A current in its kinetics, its insensitivity to tetraethylammonium, and its sensitivity to 4-aminopyridine. At the single-channel level, at least 3 classes of K channels were observed at steady depolarized potentials. They resembled the K channels found in chromaffin cells by Marty and Neher (1985). Large conductance channels (385 pS) activated around 0 mV were identified as Cl channels.},

abstract = {A simple mathematical model of intracranial pressure (ICP) dynamics oriented to clinical practice is presented. It includes the hemodynamics of the arterial-arteriolar cerebrovascular bed, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production and reabsorption processes, the nonlinear pressure-volume relationship of the craniospinal compartment, and a Starling resistor mechanism for the cerebral veins. Moreover, arterioles are controlled by cerebral autoregulation mechanisms, which are simulated by means of a time constant and a sigmoidal static characteristic. The model is used to simulate interactions between ICP, cerebral blood volume, and autoregulation. Three different related phenomena are analyzed: the generation of plateau waves, the effect of acute arterial hypotension on ICP, and the role of cerebral hemodynamics during pressure-volume index (PVI) tests. Simulation results suggest the following: 1) ICP dynamics may become unstable in patients with elevated CSF outflow resistance and decreased intracranial compliance, provided cerebral autoregulation is efficient. Instability manifests itself with the occurrence of self-sustained plateau waves. 2) Moderate acute arterial hypotension may have completely different effects on ICP, depending on the value of model parameters. If physiological compensatory mechanisms (CSF circulation and intracranial storage capacity) are efficient, acute hypotension has only negligible effects on ICP and cerebral blood flow (CBF). If these compensatory mechanisms are poor, even modest hypotension may induce a large transient increase in ICP and a significant transient reduction in CBF, with risks of secondary brain damage. 3) The ICP response to a bolus injection (PVI test) is sharply affected, via cerebral blood volume changes, by cerebral hemodynamics and autoregulation. We suggest that PVI tests may be used to extract information not only on intracranial compliance and CSF circulation, but also on the status of mechanisms controlling CBF.},

abstract = {Recurrent inhibition in olfactory bulb mitral cells is mediated via reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with granule cells. Although GABAergic granule cells express both NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptors, dendrodendritic inhibition (DDI) relies on the activation of NMDA receptors. Using whole-cell recordings from rat olfactory bulb slices, we now show that olfactory NMDA receptors have a dual role; they depolarize granule cell spines, and they provide a source of calcium that can evoke GABA exocytosis. We demonstrate that exogenous NMDA can trigger GABA release after blockade of voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) with Cd. We also find that postsynaptic depolarization alone can evoke GABA release via a separate mechanism that relies on calcium influx through Cd-sensitive VDCCs. By selectively manipulating postsynaptic responses in granule cells with high-K or low-Na extracellular solutions, we show that endogenous glutamate can elicit GABA release via both NMDA receptor- and VDCC-dependent pathways. Finally, we find that blockade of Na channels in granule cells with tetrodotoxin enhances DDI, presumably by reducing the depolarization of granule cells during DDI and thereby increasing the driving force for Ca entry through NMDA receptors. These results provide evidence of a novel mechanism for evoked transmitter release that depends on Ca influx through ionotropic receptors and provides a new potential site for synaptic plasticity in the olfactory bulb.},

abstract = {1. Whole-cell recording from pairs of adjacent mouse hippocampal neurons in culture was used to study the quantal properties of action potential-evoked excitatory synaptic transmission and to demonstrate the use of Sr2+ in quantifying those properties. 2. In the presence of extracellular Sr2+, excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were followed by an after-discharge of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) lasting 1-2 s and generated by evoked asynchronous release of presynaptic quanta of transmitter. Like the EPSC of which it is thought to be an extension, the after-discharge was modulated by procedures expected to modulate Sr2+ influx into the nerve terminal. The number of mEPSCs in the after-discharge was decreased by increasing extracellular [Mg2+], and increased by increasing extracellular [Sr2+] or increasing the number of action potentials used to evoke the after-discharge. 3. EPSCs recorded in media containing either 1 mM Ca2+ or 6 mM Sr2+ were of similar amplitude. Adding Sr2+ to low-Ca2+ media increased EPSC amplitude, while adding Sr2+ to high-Ca2+ media lowered EPSC amplitude. These results suggest that extracellular Sr2+ is less effective than Ca2+ in supporting quantal release. 4. The levels of extracellular Ca2+, Mg2+ and Sr2+ were adjusted so that most after-discharge mEPSCs were discrete and comparable in numbers to the quantal events that contributed to the corresponding evoked EPSCs. In a series of twenty-five pairs of neurons, the mean amplitude of mEPSCs recorded at -80 mV was 35 +/- 10 pA and the mean coefficient of variation was 0.50 +/- 0.10 (range, 0.26-0.62). The mEPSC amplitude histogram was positively skewed. 5. In ten pairs of neurons, the mean and variance of EPSCs and mEPSCs and quantal content were determined from samples of more than 100 evoked events (in superfusion solutions containing (mM): 0.5 Ca2+, 2 Sr2+ and 10 Mg2+) and mean quantal content was determined from the ratio of amplitudes of the mean EPSC and mEPSC. A binomial quantal analysis produced values of 2-12 for Napp (apparent number of independent synapses) and 0.25-0.75 for Papp (apparent probability of releasing a quantum at one of those synapses). These parameters predicted the number of observed failures. The observed coefficient of variation for quantal content predicted the observed coefficient of variation of the EPSC amplitude when the coefficient of variability of quantal amplitude of after-discharge mEPSCs was taken into account. 6. In six pairs of neurons, where more than 250 evoked events were recorded, the observed amplitude histogram for EPSCs could be approximated by a predicted amplitude distribution generated from the estimated binomial parameters and an empirical function describing the amplitude distribution of after-discharge mEPSCs. 7. The observation that parameters derived from mEPSCs that contribute to the Sr(2+)-generated after-discharge can predict the shape of the EPSC amplitude distribution and a quantal content consistent with the observed failure rate and EPSC amplitude variance, suggests that this subset of mEPSCs has the same properties as the quantal events released around the time of the peak of the corresponding EPSCs. The use of Sr2+ to evoke after-discharges of mEPSCs should allow unambiguous determination of the extent to which modification of synaptic strength is pre- or postsynaptic.},

abstract = {Action potential firing or depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron can induce a transient suppression of inhibitory synaptic inputs to the depolarized neuron in the cerebellum and hippocampus. This phenomenon, termed depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), is initiated postsynaptically by an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and is expressed presynaptically as a suppression of the transmitter release. It is, therefore, thought that some retrograde signal must exist from the depolarized postsynaptic neurons to the presynaptic terminals. Recent studies on hippocampal neurons have revealed that endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) play a key role as a retrograde messenger. There are, however, conflicting reports that glutamate may be a candidate retrograde messenger for cerebellar DSI that acts on presynaptic group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). In this study, we examined whether endocannabinoids mediate retrograde signal for cerebellar DSI. We recorded IPSCs from Purkinje cells by stimulating putative basket cell axons in mouse cerebellar slices. DSI was readily induced in evoked IPSCs by a depolarizing pulse train. We found that DSI was completely occluded by a cannabinoid agonist, WIN55,212-2, was totally eliminated by a specific antagonist of the type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptor, SR141716A, and was deficient in the CB1 knock-out mouse. In contrast, a group II mGluR-specific agonist, (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine, did not completely occlude DSI, and an mGluR antagonist, (RS)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine, had no depressant effect on DSI. These results clearly indicate that the CB1 receptor mediates retrograde signal for DSI in cerebellar Purkinje cells.},

abstract = {In this essay I will sketch some ideas for how to think about models in biology. I will begin by trying to dispel the myth that quantitative modeling is somehow foreign to biology. I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as 'predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

Dissociated rat hippocampal neurons were plated on polylysine-coated glass cover slips and grown in culture for 1-4 weeks. Fixed cultures were stained with Dil and visualized with the CLSM. Spine density, spine length, and diameters of spine heads and necks were measured. Some cultures were immunostained for synaptophysin and others prepared for EM analysis. In the 1-3 week cultures, 92-95% of the neurons contained spiny dendrites. Two subpopulations of spine morphologies were distinguished. At 1 week in culture, "headless" spines constituted 50% of the spine population and were equal in length to the spines with heads. At 2, 3, and 4 weeks in culture headless spines constituted a progressively smaller fraction of the population and were, on average, shorter than spines with heads. Spines with heads had narrower necks than headless spines. At 3 weeks in culture, spines were associated with synaptophysin-immunoreactive labeling, resembling synaptic terminals. At 4 weeks in culture, only 70% of the Dil-filled cells had spiny dendrites, and the density of spines decreased. Ultrastructurally, the majority of dendritic spine-like structures at 1 week resembled long filopodia without synaptic contacts. The majority of axospinous synapses were on short "stubby" spines. At 3 weeks in culture, the spines were characteristic of those seen in vivo. They contained no microtubules or polyribosomes, were filled with a characteristic, filamentous material, and formed asymmetric synapses. These studies provide the basis for further analysis of the rules governing the formation, development, and plasticity of dendritic spines under controlled, in vitro conditions.},

In the absence of agonists, neither the association nor the dissociation binding components varied with temperature, suggesting a diffusion-controlled limitation of access of the ligand to its site within the nonactivated NMDA receptor. No evidence was found for a temperature-dependent change in the density of [3H]TCP binding sites or for heterogeneity of [3H]TCP binding sites associated with the NMDA receptor, even though when approaching equilibrium the binding kinetics in the presence of glutamate and glycine deviated from an ordinary bimolecular reaction scheme. The data were fitted instead to a two-exponent binding function, comprising the sum of a fast and a slow binding component. Their corresponding time constants exhibited an increase with temperature, and the increase of each one was correlated significantly with the corresponding decrease in the equilibrium binding constant; however, there was no temperature-related change in the relative proportions of the two components, with the fast binding component (alpha) accounting for 50-70% of the site population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The cerebrospinal fluid pulse pressure (CSFPP) has found application as a measure of intracranial elastance. However, CSFPP is also dependent on the magnitude of the pulsatile variation in cerebral blood volume (delta Vb). The purpose of the present study was to assess the effect on delta Vb of changes in systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) as well as elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP). Therefore, delta Vb was computed from the electromagnetically measured flow profile in the vertebral artery of the dog on the assumption of a nonpulsatile cerebral venous outflow. During arterial hypotension, delta Vb was increased due to a shift of flow from diastole to systole, whereas mean flow was not affected. The reverse phenomenon was observed when SAP was raised. Changes in PaCO2 had little effect on pulsatile blood flow. The changes in total blood flow that occurred were evenly distributed over the cardiac cycle. Consequently, delta Vb was not significantly affected, although CSFPP was considerably changed. When ICP was raised, a breakpoint pressure was observed above which cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreased and CSFPP and delta Vb increased. This contradiction was explained by the finding of a decrease in diastolic flow, causing the fall in CBF, whereas systolic flow relative to mean flow was increased, resulting in an increased delta Vb. The underlying mechanisms of the pulsatile flow changes are extensively discussed. It is argued that the arterial inflow profile is largely determined by the compliance of the inflow section of the cerebral vascular bed. Vascular compliance is significantly altered by changes in SAP and ICP because they affect the transmural pressure of the vessels, whereas this is not the case during changes in PaCO2.},

abstract = {Synaptic release of glutamate results in a two component excitatory postsynaptic current (e.p.s.c.) at many vertebrate central synapses. Non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors mediate a component that has a rapid onset and decay while the component mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors has a slow rise-time and a decay of several hundred milliseconds, 100 times longer than the mean open time of NMDA channels. The slow decay of the NMDA-mediated e.p.s.c. could be due to residual glutamate in the synaptic cleft resulting in repeated binding and activation of NMDA receptors. However, in cultured hippocampal neurons, we find that the NMDA receptor antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate has no effect on the slow e.p.s.c. when rapidly applied after activation of the synapse, suggesting that rebinding of glutamate does not occur. In addition, a brief pulse of glutamate to an outside-out membrane patch results in openings of NMDA channels that persist for hundreds of milliseconds, indicating that glutamate can remain bound for this period. These results imply that a brief pulse of glutamate in the synaptic cleft is sufficient to account for the slow e.p.s.c.},

abstract = {A deconvolution approach for dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging using an approximation basis of exponential functions constrained to be non-negative and non-increasing is developed and compared with widely used methods. Monotonicity in an exponential basis is implemented in terms of a newly derived condition which is a considerable generalization over a previous condition that implies complete monotonicity. Since the constraints imply a bound on the total variation, a well known staircasing effect may result with other approximation bases, but an exponential basis is shown to resist staircasing. In addition to the choice of approximation basis, further regularization is implemented in terms of the number of basis functions and the distribution of their parameters. The exponential approach is applied to dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data to determine physiological parameters pixelwise to visualize a cerebral tumor, and the results are compared favorably with those of the standard truncated singular value decomposition approach. In particular, kernels estimated with constrained exponentials are free of oscillations and staircasing, and the images of estimated kernel parameters are sharper than those obtained by truncated singular value decomposition.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that estradiol causes a twofold rise in dendritic spine density in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, as it does in vivo. More recently, estrogen receptors have been localized to aspiny inhibitory hippocampal interneurons, indicating that their effect on spiny pyramidal neurons may be indirect. We therefore examined the possibility that estradiol affects spine density by regulating inhibition in cultured hippocampal interneurons. Immunocytochemically, estrogen receptors were found to be co-localized with glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-positive neurons (approximately 21% of total neurons in the culture). Exposure of cultures to estradiol for 1 d caused a marked decrease (up to 80%) in the GAD content of the interneurons, measured both by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Also, the number of GAD-positive neurons in the cultures decreased to 12% of the total cell population. Moreover, GABAergic miniature IPSCs were reduced in both size and frequency by estradiol, whereas miniature EPSCs increased in frequency. We then mimicked the proposed effects of estradiol by blocking GABA synthesis with mercaptopropionic acid (MA). Cultures treated with MA expressed a dose-dependent decrease in GABA immunostaining that mimicked that seen with estradiol. MA-treated cultures displayed a significant 50% increase in dendritic spine density over controls, similar to that produced by estradiol. These results indicate that estradiol decreases GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus, which appears to effectively increase the excitatory drive on pyramidal cells, and thus may provide a mechanism for formation of new dendritic spines.},

Rat sciatic nerves were demyelinated by lysolecithin and single fibers were examined with patch clamp techniques. Voltage-dependent sodium currents were measured in both internodal and nodal regions. The results suggested that while there is a sharp gradient in channel density at the node of Ranvier, the total number of internodal channels far exceeds the total number of nodal channels. The nodal channels do not diffuse freely following demyelination and the internodal channels may thus serve important functions as conduction is restored.},

abstract = {To probe for the role of the L1 cell surface glycoprotein during neurite outgrowth and fasciculation in the early postnatal mouse cerebellar cortex, a microexplant culture system was used. Fasciculation of neurites was reduced in the presence of antigen-binding fragments (Fab) of poly- and monoclonal L1 antibodies, as compared to untreated controls. In addition, speed of neurite outgrowth was enhanced in the presence of antibodies. Migration of cell bodies of small neurons was also significantly increased. Very similar effects on these outgrowth parameters were observed with Fab fragments from poly- and monoclonal neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) antibodies. Antibodies from preimmune sera had no effect. These findings suggest that L1 antigen not only plays a role in adhesion of isolated neural cell bodies and migration of granule cell neurons in the early postnatal mouse cerebellar cortex (Lindner et al., 1983; Rathjen and Schachner, 1984), but also in neurite outgrowth and fasciculation.},

abstract = {Analysis and interpretation of current records from cellular membranes or lipid bilayers is complicated by perturbations. These perturbations can originate from random noise or deterministic artifacts as capacitive currents caused by step depolarization's, drift, 50 Hz pick up or microphonics. Accurate removal of deterministic perturbations is a prerequisite for further analysis of ion channel kinetics. In this report we present two methods developed for parameter estimation of such artifacts in order to remove these perturbations from single channel patch clamp traces. For both methods artifact removal does not require sweeps lacking channel activity. The first method was designed to extract artifacts from sweeps showing moderate channel activity. Within a certain number of sweeps the artifacts should remain rather constant. The second method allows for artifact removal from one individual sweep with channel activity. With the second method, correction for drift, pick up and microphonics is possible without long periods of minor channel activity. To evaluate the correctness of artifact removal a specific test was set up. The methods were carefully examined using simulated records for a wide range of parameters found in single channel experiments. Further, the developed algorithms were applied to original records obtained from cardiac and recombinant L-type Ca2+ channels.},

The simplified model takes the form of a set of binary chains that are interdependent according to a simple lumped coupling parameter. When varied, this parameter realizes a range of behaviors from tight coupling to complete independence. Other model parameters describe the intrinsic characteristics of the binary chains. An identification procedure for the model parameters is developed based on hidden Markov modeling ideas but incorporating a novel parameter estimation. The usefulness of the model in analyzing certain types of data is demonstrated with examples of real channel currents.},

abstract = {In the mammalian nervous system, K+ channels regulate diverse aspects of neuronal function and are encoded by a large set of K+ channel genes. The roles of different K+ channel proteins could be dictated by their localization to specific subcellular domains. We report that two K+ channel polypeptides, Kv1.4 and Kv4.2, which form transient (A-type) K+ channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, are segregated in rat central neurons. Kv1.4 protein is targeted to axons and possibly terminals, while Kv4.2 is concentrated in dendrites and somata. This differential distribution implies distinct roles for these channel proteins in vivo. Their localizations suggest that Kv1.4 and Kv4.2 may regulate synaptic transmission via presynaptic, or postsynaptic mechanisms, respectively.},

abstract = {The relationships among cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume, intracranial pressure (ICP), and the action of cerebrovascular regulatory mechanisms (autoregulation and CO2 reactivity) were investigated by means of a mathematical model. The model incorporates the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation, the intracranial pressure-volume relationship, and cerebral hemodynamics. The latter is based on the following main assumptions: the middle cerebral arteries behave passively following transmural pressure changes; the pial arterial circulation includes two segments (large and small pial arteries) subject to different autoregulation mechanisms; and the venous cerebrovascular bed behaves as a Starling resistor. A new aspect of the model exists in the description of CO2 reactivity in the pial arterial circulation and in the analysis of its nonlinear interaction with autoregulation. Simulation results, obtained at constant ICP using various combinations of mean arterial pressure and CO2 pressure, substantially support data on cerebral blood flow and velocity reported in the physiological literature concerning both the separate effects of CO2 and autoregulation and their nonlinear interaction. Simulations performed in dynamic conditions with varying ICP underline the existence of a significant correlation between ICP dynamics and cerebral hemodynamics in response to CO2 changes. This correlation may significantly increase in pathological subjects with poor intracranial compliance and reduced CSF outflow. In perspective, the model can be used to study ICP and blood velocity time patterns in neurosurgical patients in order to gain a deeper insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to intracranial hypertension and secondary brain damage.},

abstract = {This manuscript considers the following "graph classification" question: given a collection of graphs and associated classes, how can one predict the class of a newly observed graph? To address this question we propose a statistical model for graph/class pairs. This model naturally leads to a set of estimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or "signal-subgraph," defined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between the classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal and efficient, but differ by their assumption about the "coherency" of the signal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges "stick together" around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best estimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but also the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a contemporary neuroscience question: can we classify "connectomes" (brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better than all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates that even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of training samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of salt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions.},

In this model, the two hemispheres are connected through the circle of Willis by an anterior communicating artery (ACoA) of varying size. The right hemisphere has no cerebrovascular reactivity and the left is normally reactive. The authors studied the asymmetry of hemispheric blood flow in response to simulated changes in arterial blood pressure and carbon dioxide concentration. The hemispheric blood flow was dependent on the local regulatory capacity but not on the size of the ACoA. Flow through the ACoA and carotid artery was strongly dependent on the size of the communicating artery. A global interhemispheric "steal effect" was demonstrated to be unlikely to occur in subjects with nonstenosed carotid arteries. Vasoreactive effects on intracranial pressure had a major influence on the circulation in both hemispheres, provoking additional changes in blood flow on the nonregulating side. A method for the quantification of the crosscirculatory capacity has been proposed.},

abstract = {There is considerable evidence that glutamate is the principal neurotransmitter that mediates fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate central nervous system. This single transmitter seems to activate two or three distinct types of receptors, defined by their affinities for three selective structural analogues of glutamate, NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), quisqualate and kainate. All these agonists increase membrane permeability to monovalent cations, but NMDA also activates a conductance that permits significant calcium influx and is blocked in a voltage-dependent manner by extracellular magnesium. Fast synaptic excitation seems to be mediated mainly by kainate/quisqualate receptors, although NMDA receptors are sometimes activated. We have investigated the properties of these conductances using single-channel recording in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, because the hippocampus contains all subtypes of glutamate receptors and because long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission occurs in this structure. We find that four or more distinct single-channel currents are evoked by applying glutamate to each outside-out membrane patch. These conductances vary in their ionic permeability and in the agonist most effective in causing them to open. Clear transitions between all the conductance levels are observed. Our observations are compatible with the model that all the single channel conductances activated by glutamate reflect the operation of one or two complex molecular entities.},

abstract = {1. The properties of single Ca2+-activated K+ channels in cultured rat superior cervical ganglionic neurones were studied in cell-attached and excised patches using the patch-clamp technique. 2. In cell-attached patches using an external K+ concentration ([K+]o) of 150 mM, approximately equal to the internal [K+], the channel slope conductance was approximately 200 pS and independent of membrane voltage between -50 and +50 mV. Using [K+]o of 4.7 mM (providing a near physiological K+ gradient), the I-V relationship was non-linear with a slope conductance of approximately 120 pS at 0 mV. 3. The channel was selective for K+ over Cs+ and Na+ which were impermeant from either side of the membrane. Both Na+ and Cs+ also blocked the movement of K+ through the channel. Cs+ was active on either side of the membrane, whereas Na+ apparently blocked the channel only when applied to the cytoplasmic side. 4. The channel was activated by increasing the Ca2+ concentration on the inside of the membrane ([Ca2+]i). The channel was virtually inactive when [Ca2+]i = 0.01 microM. Depolarizing the patch at a constant [Ca2+]i usually further increased the opening probability. 5. The gating properties of the channel were studied using cell-attached patches. At potentials more negative than the resting membrane potential, the open-time distribution was described by a single exponential. On depolarization, two exponentials were required. The closed-time distribution was fitted by three exponentials. 6. Depolarization of the patch caused the long mean open lifetime to increase whilst the short mean open and closed lifetimes were unaffected. Both the intermediate and long mean closed lifetimes decreased with depolarization from -60 to +60 mV. 7. In cell-attached patches, the long mean open lifetimes were usually smaller than those observed in excised patches at depolarized potentials (greater than 0 mV). 8. A fourth closed state, possibly representing an inactivated form of the channel, was infrequently observed. A 50% substate of the full single-channel current was also observed occasionally. This substate was always associated with openings to the full current state. 9. The channel was blockable by external tetraethylammonium (25 microM-1 mM), Ba2+ (1-10 mM), and quinine (10-200 microM). External d-tubocurarine (25-100 microM) also blocked this IC channel. However it was insensitive to apamin (100-300 nM), muscarine (10 microM) and 4-aminopyridine (1-3 mM). The channel was also blocked by internal tetraethylammonium (5-10 mM) or Ba2+ (0.3-1 mM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between changes in brain tissue haemodynamics, oxygenation and oxidised cytochrome-c-oxidase ([oxCCO]) in the adult brain during hyperoxia and hypercapnea. 10 healthy volunteers were studied. We measured the mean blood flow velocity of the right middle cerebral artery (Vmca) with transcranial Doppler (TCD) and changes in concentrations of total haemoglobin ([HbT]=[HbO2]+[HHb]), haemoglobin difference ([Hbdiff]=[HbO2]-[HHb]) and [oxCCO] with broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We also measured the absolute tissue oxygenation index (TOI) using NIR spatially resolved spectroscopy. During hyperoxia there was an increase in TOI (2.33 +/- 0.29%), [Hbdiff] (4.57 +/- 1.27 microM) and in the oxidation of [oxCCO] (0.09 +/- 0.12 microM); but a reduction in Vmca (5.85 +/- 4.85%) and HbT (1.29 +/- 0.91 microM). During hyperoxia there was a positive correlation between [oxCCO] and TOI and [Hbdiff] (r=0.83 and r=0.95) and a negative association between [oxCCO] and Vmca and [HbT] (r=-0.74 and r=-0.87). During hypercapnea there was an increase in TOI (2.76 +/- 2.16%), [Hbdiff] (7.36 +/- 2.64), [HbT] (2.61 +/- 2.7 microM), Vmca (14.92 +/- 17.5%) and in the oxidation of [oxCCO] (0.25 +/- 0.17 microM). Correlation analysis shows that there was association between [oxCCO] and TOI, [Hbdiff] and [HbT] (r=0.83, r=0.93 and r=0.82) but not with Vmca (r=0.33). We conclude that an increase in [oxCCO] was seen during both challenges and it was highly associated with brain tissue oxygenation.},

In the fields of single molecule light microscopy and spectroscopy, force microscopy and spectroscopy as well as other techniques like electrophysiology, sophisticated data analysis algorithms are available which extract the interesting parameters and their uncertainties from the noisy data set. The intrinsic distributions of these parameters contain valuable information about the molecules' physical and chemical properties, that need to be deconvoluted from the data. Here, we present an expectation-maximisation (EM-) algorithm that estimates the intrinsic distribution in single molecule experiments. The performance is tested by using computer simulations and the application of the method is demonstrated for data from single molecule force spectroscopy.},

The total numbers of migrating neuroblasts and their precursor cells or blast cells derived from the mutant cerebellum were markedly reduced in comparison with their normal counterparts. However, no difference was shown between these two strains in either the numbers of blast cells or neuroblasts that migrated from single explants. In addition, all behaviors examined, such as migration of neuroblasts and the proliferation of blast cells in culture were identical between both genotypes. Thus, behaviors of both granule cells and their precursors in the cerebellar cortex of reeler mutant mouse may be qualitatively identical to those of normal counterparts, but precursors of granule cells in the external germinal layer of the cerebellar cortex may be reduced in the reeler mouse.},

abstract = {Dendritic spines are of major importance in information processing and memory formation in central neurons. Estradiol has been shown to induce an increase of dendritic spine density on hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) recently has been implicated in neuronal maturation, plasticity, and regulation of GABAergic interneurons. We now demonstrate that estradiol down-regulates BDNF in cultured hippocampal neurons to 40% of control values within 24 hr of exposure. This, in turn, decreases inhibition and increases excitatory tone in pyramidal neurons, leading to a 2-fold increase in dendritic spine density. Exogenous BDNF blocks the effects of estradiol on spine formation, and BDNF depletion with a selective antisense oligonucleotide mimics the effects of estradiol. Addition of BDNF antibodies also increases spine density, and diazepam, which facilitates GABAergic neurotransmission, blocks estradiol-induced spine formation. These observations demonstrate a functional link between estradiol, BDNF as a potent regulator of GABAergic interneurons, and activity-dependent formation of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons.},

In Purkinje cells, we found that large-amplitude miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were inhibited by ryanodine or by long-term removal of extracellular Ca2+. Two-photon Ca2+ imaging revealed random, ryanodine-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ transients, spatially constrained at putative presynaptic terminals. At high concentration, ryanodine decreased action-potential-evoked rises in intracellular Ca2+. Immuno-localization showed ryanodine receptors in these terminals. Our data suggest that large mIPSCs are multivesicular events regulated by Ca2+ release from ryanodine-sensitive presynaptic Ca2+ stores.},

This study reports the $\Delta$[oxCCO] response measured in such a setting and investigates possible confounders of this measurement. Continuous frontal lobe NIRS measurements were collected from 11 healthy volunteers during a 6-minute anagram-solving task, using a hybrid optical spectrometer (pHOS) that combines multi-distance frequency and broadband components. Only data sets showing a hemodynamic response consistent with functional activation were interrogated for a $\Delta$[oxCCO] response. Simultaneous systemic monitoring data were also available. Possible influences on the $\Delta$[oxCCO] response were systematically investigated and there was no effect of: 1) wavelength range chosen for fitting the measured attenuation spectra; 2) constant or measured, with the pHOS in real-time, differential pathlength factor; 3) systemic hemodynamic changes during functional activation; 4) changes in optical scattering during functional activation. The $\Delta$[oxCCO] response measured in the presence of functional activation was heterogeneous, with the majority of subjects showing significant increase in oxidation, but others having a decrease. We conclude that the heterogeneity in the $\Delta$[oxCCO] response is physiological and not induced by confounding factors in the measurements.},

abstract = {Brief depolarization of cerebellar Purkinje cells was found to inhibit parallel fiber and climbing fiber EPSCs for tens of seconds. This depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE) is accompanied by altered paired-pulse plasticity, suggesting a presynaptic locus. Fluorometric imaging revealed that postsynaptic depolarization also reduces presynaptic calcium influx. The inhibition of both presynaptic calcium influx and EPSCs is eliminated by buffering postsynaptic calcium with BAPTA. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 prevents DSE, and the agonist WIN 55,212-2 occludes DSE. These findings suggest that Purkinje cells release endogenous cannabinoids in response to elevated calcium, thereby inhibiting presynaptic calcium entry and suppressing transmitter release. DSE may provide a way for cells to use their firing rate to dynamically regulate synaptic inputs. Together with previous studies, these findings suggest a widespread role for endogenous cannabinoids in retrograde synaptic inhibition.},

abstract = {Large voltage-dependent outward currents are recorded with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique from rat cultured astrocytes under conditions where an outward movement of potassium ions is excluded (either by blockage of the potassium channels pharmacologically or by replacement of the internal potassium by the impermeant large organic cation N-methyl-(+)-glucamine). The current, which is activated at potentials more positive than -40 to -50 mV, is normally carried by an inward movement of chloride ions. Its reversal potential is the same as the chloride equilibrium potential. With depolarization to +60 mV (for 225 ms) little or no inactivation of the current occurs: with depolarizations to +90 to +110 mV a time-dependent decay is seen. The current, which is often not marked immediately after formation of the whole-cell clamp, generally increases over a period of a few minutes to a maximum (after which it usually declines), as if some as yet unknown intracellular factor keeping the channels closed were being washed away from the membrane. The time course of this phenomenon is not affected by changing of the internal free calcium concentration (from 10(-8)M to 10(-6)M) or by an intracellular mixture of cyclic AMP (1 mM), ATP (4 mM) and Mg+ (2 mM). The conductance is slightly increased when the chloride of the bathing medium is replaced by bromide; is much reduced on replacement by methylsulphate, sulphate, isethionate, or acetate; and is virtually abolished on replacement by the large anion gluconate. The outward current is inhibited by the disulphonate stilbenes DIDS and SITS; this blocking action was initially partly reversible, although never completely so. It is suggested that the chloride conductance plays a role in the spatial buffering of potassium by astrocytes.},

abstract = {Perceived-pitch tracking of potentially aperiodic sounds, as well as pitch tracking of multiple simultaneous sources, is shown to be feasible using a probabilistic methodology. The use of a shift-invariant representation in the constant-Q domain allows the modeling of perceived pitch changes as vertical shifts of spectra. This enables the tracking of these changes in sounds with an arbitrary spectral profile, even those where pitch would be an ill-defined quantity. It is further possible to extend this approach to a mixture model, which allows simultaneous tracking of varying mixed sounds. Demonstrations on real recordings highlight the robustness of such a model under various adverse conditions, and also show some of its unique conceptual differences when compared to traditional pitch tracking approaches.},

abstract = {A novel NMDA receptor-like (NMDAR-L) cDNA was isolated that contained an open reading frame coding for a predicted polypeptide of 1115 amino acids that shares approximately 27% identity with NMDA receptor subunits. In situ hybridization experiments indicated that NMDAR-L mRNA was expressed in the developing rodent CNS. On postnatal day 1 (P1), NMDAR-L mRNA expression was pronounced in the entorhinal cortex, the subiculum and the thalamus, in layer V of the developing neocortex, in the superior and inferior colliculi, and various regions of the hindbrain, excluding the cerebellum. On P5, NMDAR-L mRNA was expressed in layer V of the neocortex, in the entorhinal cortex, in the subiculum, and in the thalamus. On P14, NMDAR-L mRNA was expressed in layers II-VI of the neocortex, in the entorhinal and piriform cortex, in the subiculum and CA1 field, and in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. In the adult brain, NMDAR-L mRNA was detected predominately in the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract. Injection of NMDAR-L cRNA into Xenopus oocytes did not lead to the expression of homomeric glutamate-activated channels. However, coinjection of the triple combination of NMDAR-L with NMDAR1 and NMDAR2B cRNAs led to a striking decrease in the current magnitude compared to currents obtained after coexpression of the double combination of NMDAR1 with NMDAR2B. While the function of NMDAR-L remains to be established, its developmental and regional expression pattern suggests that NMDAR-L may influence axonal outgrowth and synaptogenesis during brain development.},

abstract = {The contribution of intersynaptic transmitter diffusion to the AMPA receptor EPSC time course was studied in cultured CA1 hippocampal neurons. Reducing release probability 20-fold with cadmium did not affect the time course of the averaged AMPA receptor EPSC, even when receptor desensitization was blocked by cyclothiazide, suggesting that individual synapses contribute independently to the AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC. Deconvolution of the averaged miniature EPSC from the evoked EPSC showed that release probability decays only slightly faster than the EPSC, suggesting that the AMPA receptor EPSC time course is determined primarily by the asynchrony of vesicle release. Further experiments demonstrated that cyclothiazide, previously thought to affect only AMPA receptor kinetics, also enhances synaptic release.},

abstract = {Using intracellular recording techniques in CA1 cells in the hippocampal slice, we studied the responses of cells to synaptically released and iontophoretically applied GABA. With high-resistance, Cl(-)-filled electrodes, which inverted and enlarged the responses at normal resting potentials, we examined spontaneous GABA-mediated IPSPs. Usually we recorded the spontaneous events in the presence of carbachol (10-25 microM), which significantly increased IPSP frequency and blocked potentially confounding K+ conductances. Following a train of action potentials, spontaneous IPSPs were transiently suppressed. This suppression could not be accounted for by membrane conductance changes following the train or activation of a recurrent circuit. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in the slice indicated that the amplitudes of the spontaneous GABAA inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were also diminished following the action potential train. In some cases BAY K 8644, a Ca2+ channel agonist, enhanced the suppression of IPSPs, while buffering changes in [Ca2+]i with EGTA or BAPTA prevented it. The monosynaptically evoked IPSC in the presence of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APN) was also diminished following a train of action potentials; however, iontophoretically applied GABA responses did not change significantly. These studies suggest that localized physiological changes in postsynaptic [Ca2+]i potently modulate synaptic GABAA inputs and that this modulation may be an important regulatory mechanism in mammalian brain.},

abstract = {Cutting the axon of a morphologically polarized neuron (stage 3) close to the cell body causes another neurite to grow as an axon [1-3]. Stage 3 neurons still lack molecular segregation of axonal and dendritic proteins, however. Axonal and dendritic compartments acquire their distinct composition at stage 4 (4-5days in culture), when proteins such as the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) and the glutamate receptor subunit GluR1 localize to the dendrites and disappear from the axon [4,5]. We investigated whether cultured hippocampal neurons retained axon/dendrite plasticity after axons and dendrites have created their distinct cytoskeletal architecture and acquired their specific membrane composition. We found that axotomy of stage 4 neurons transformed a dendrite into an axon. Using axonal and dendritic markers, we tested whether cytoskeletal changes could cause similar transformations, and found that actin depolymerization induced multiple axons in unpolarized neurons. Moreover, depletion of actin filaments from both morphologically and molecularly polarized cells also resulted in the growth of multiple axons from pre-existing dendrites. These results imply that dendrites retain the potential to become axons even after molecular segregation has occurred and that the dendritic fate depends on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Dynamic mathematical models in the form of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) play an important role in systems biology. For any sufficiently complex model, the speed and accuracy of solving the ODEs by numerical integration is critical. This applies especially to systems identification problems where the parameter sensitivities must be integrated alongside the system variables. Although several very good general purpose ODE solvers exist, few of them compute the parameter sensitivities automatically.

RESULTS:We present a novel integration algorithm that is based on second derivatives and contains other unique features such as improved error estimates. These features allow the integrator to take larger time steps than other methods. In practical applications, i.e. systems biology models of different sizes and behaviors, the method competes well with established integrators in solving the system equations, and it outperforms them significantly when local parameter sensitivities are evaluated. For ease-of-use, the solver is embedded in a framework that automatically generates the integrator input from an SBML description of the system of interest.

CONCLUSIONS:For future applications, comparatively 'cheap' parameter sensitivities will enable advances in solving large, otherwise computationally expensive parameter estimation and optimization problems. More generally, we argue that substantially better computational performance can be achieved by exploiting characteristics specific to the problem domain; elements of our methods such as the error estimation could find broader use in other, more general numerical algorithms.},

abstract = {Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the relationship between the redox state of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase CuA and haemoglobin oxygenation in the isoflurane-anaesthetized neonatal pig brain. Adding 7% CO2 to the inspired gases increased the total haemoglobin concentration by 8 microM and oxidized CuA by 0.2 microM. Decreasing the inspired oxygen fraction to zero for 90 s dropped the oxyhaemoglobin concentration by 27 microM and reduced CuA by 1.8 microM. However, no change in the CuA redox state was observed until oxyhaemoglobin had decreased by more than 10 microM. The response of the CuA redox state to these stimuli was very similar following 80% replacement of the haemoglobin by a perfluorocarbon blood substitute; this demonstrates that the results in the normal haematocrit were not a spectral artefact due to the high haemoglobin/cytochrome oxidase ratio. We conclude that the large reductions in the CuA redox state during anoxia are caused by a decrease in the rate of oxygen delivery to the cytochrome oxidase oxygen binding site; the small oxidations, however, are likely to reflect the effects of metabolic changes on the redox state of CuA, rather than increases in the rate of oxygen delivery.},

abstract = {1. We have expressed recombinant NR1a/NR2A and NR1a/NR2D N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor channels in Xenopus oocytes and made recordings of single-channel and macroscopic currents in outside-out membrane patches. For each receptor type we measured (a) the individual single-channel activations evoked by low glutamate concentrations in steady-state recordings, and (b) the macroscopic responses elicited by brief concentration jumps with high agonist concentrations, and we explore the relationship between these two sorts of observation. 2. Low concentration (5-100 nM) steady-state recordings of NR1a/NR2A and NR1a/NR2D single-channel activity generated shut-time distributions that were best fitted with a mixture of five and six exponential components, respectively. Individual activations of either receptor type were resolved as bursts of openings, which we refer to as 'super-clusters'. 3. During a single activation, NR1a/NR2A receptors were open for 36 % of the time, but NR1a/NR2D receptors were open for only 4 % of the time. For both, distributions of super-cluster durations were best fitted with a mixture of six exponential components. Their overall mean durations were 35.8 and 1602 ms, respectively. 4. Steady-state super-clusters were aligned on their first openings and averaged. The average was well fitted by a sum of exponentials with time constants taken from fits to super-cluster length distributions. It is shown that this is what would be expected for a channel that shows simple Markovian behaviour. 5. The current through NR1a/NR2A channels following a concentration jump from zero to 1 mM glutamate for 1 ms was well fitted by three exponential components with time constants of 13 ms (rising phase), 70 ms and 350 ms (decaying phase). Similar concentration jumps on NR1a/NR2D channels were well fitted by two exponentials with means of 45 ms (rising phase) and 4408 ms (decaying phase) components. During prolonged exposure to glutamate, NR1a/NR2A channels desensitized with a time constant of 649 ms, while NR1a/NR2D channels exhibited no apparent desensitization. 6. We show that under certain conditions, the time constants for the macroscopic jump response should be the same as those for the distribution of super-cluster lengths, though the resolution of the latter is so much greater that it cannot be expected that all the components will be resolvable in a macroscopic current. Good agreement was found for jumps on NR1a/NR2D receptors, and for some jump experiments on NR1a/NR2A. However, the latter were rather variable and some were slower than predicted. Slow decays were associated with patches that had large currents.},

abstract = {We have developed a scanning patch-clamp technique that facilitates single-channel recording from small cells and submicron cellular structures that are inaccessible by conventional methods. The scanning patch-clamp technique combines scanning ion conductance microscopy and patch-clamp recording through a single glass nanopipette probe. In this method the nanopipette is first scanned over a cell surface, using current feedback, to obtain a high-resolution topographic image. This same pipette is then used to make the patch-clamp recording. Because image information is obtained via the patch electrode it can be used to position the pipette onto a cell with nanometer precision. The utility of this technique is demonstrated by obtaining ion channel recordings from the top of epithelial microvilli and openings of cardiomyocyte T-tubules. Furthermore, for the first time we have demonstrated that it is possible to record ion channels from very small cells, such as sperm cells, under physiological conditions as well as record from cellular microstructures such as submicron neuronal processes.},

abstract = {A modified method for maximum-likelihood deconvolution of astronomical adaptive optics images is presented. By parametrizing the anisoplanatic character of the point-spread function (PSF), a simultaneous optimization of the spatially variant PSF and the deconvolved image can be performed. In the ideal case of perfect information, it is shown that the algorithm is able to perfectly cancel the adverse effects of anisoplanatism down to the level of numerical precision. Exploring two different modes of deconvolution (using object bases of pixel values or stellar field parameters), we then quantify the performance of the algorithm in the presence of Poissonian noise for crowded and noncrowded stellar fields.},

These channels must obey the principle of detailed balance in thermodynamic equilibrium; otherwise, the channel is driven by an external source of energy. We investigate the power of a likelihood ratio test for detailed balance for a number of data points which is in the order of magnitude of patch clamp experiments. We show that for certain models with nearly equal dwell times, a test for detailed balance suffers from a loss of power to detect violations of detailed balance which is due to the non-identifiability of the transition rates for models with equal dwell times.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a hydrologic application of a new statistical learning methodology called support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are based on minimization of a bound on the generalized error (risk) model, rather than just the mean square error over a training set. Due to Mercer's conditions on the kernels, the corresponding optimization problems are convex and hence have no local minima. In this paper, SVMs are illustratively used to reproduce the behavior of Monte Carlo-based flow and transport models that are in turn used in the design of a ground water contamination detection monitoring system. The traditional approach, which is based on solving transient transport equations for each new configuration of a conductivity field, is too time consuming in practical applications. Thus, there is a need to capture the behavior of the transport phenomenon in random media in a relatively simple manner. The objective of the exercise is to maximize the probability of detecting contaminants that exceed some regulatory standard before they reach a compliance boundary, while minimizing cost (i.e., number of monitoring wells). Application of the method at a generic site showed a rather promising performance, which leads us to believe that SVMs could be successfully employed in other areas of hydrology. The SVM was trained using 510 monitoring configuration samples generated from 200 Monte Carlo flow and transport realizations. The best configurations of well networks selected by the SVM were identical with the ones obtained from the physical model, but the reliabilities provided by the respective networks differ slightly.},

abstract = {Some ideas from quantum theory are just beginning to percolate back to classical probability theory. For example, there is a widely used and successful theory of "chemical reaction networks", which describes the interactions of molecules in a stochastic rather than quantum way. Computer science and population biology use the same ideas under a different name: "stochastic Petri nets". But if we look at these theories from the perspective of quantum theory, they turn out to involve creation and annihilation operators, coherent states and other well-known ideas - but in a context where probabilities replace amplitudes. We explain this connection as part of a detailed analogy between quantum mechanics and stochastic mechanics. We use this analogy to present new proofs of two major results in the theory of chemical reaction networks: the deficiency zero theorem and the Anderson-Craciun-Kurtz theorem. We also study the overlap of quantum mechanics and stochastic mechanics, which involves Hamiltonians that can generate either unitary or stochastic time evolution. These Hamiltonians are called "Dirichlet forms", and they arise naturally from electrical circuits made only of resistors.},

abstract = {Markov processes are routinely used as models for stochastic processes. They are often justified on the basis of randomization and coarse-graining assumptions. Here instead, we derive n-th-order Markov processes and the time-homogeneous master equation as unique solutions to an inverse problem. In particular, we find that when the constraints are not enough to uniquely determine the stochastic model, the n-th-order Markov process emerges as the unique maximum entropy solution to this otherwise under-determined problem. This gives a rigorous alternative for justifying such models while providing a systematic recipe for generalizing widely accepted stochastic models usually assumed to follow from first principles.},

abstract = {The time pattern of intracranial pressure (ICP) during pressure-volume index (PVI) tests was analyzed in 20 patients with severe acute brain damage by means of a simple mathematical model. In most cases, a satisfactory fitting between model response and patient data was achieved by adjusting only four parameters: the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow resistance, the intracranial elastance coefficient, and the gain and time constant of cerebral autoregulation. The correlation between the parameter estimates was also analyzed to elucidate the main mechanisms responsible for ICP changes in each patient. Starting from information on the estimated parameter values and their correlation, the patients were classified into two main classes: those with weak autoregulation (8 of 20 patients) and those with strong autoregulation (12 of 20 patients). In the first group of patients, ICP mainly reflects CSF circulation and passive cerebral blood volume changes. In the second group, ICP exhibits paradoxical responses attributable to active changes in cerebral blood volume. Moreover, in two patients of the second group, the time constant of autoregulation is significantly increased (>40 s). The correlation between the parameter estimates was significantly different in the two groups of patients, suggesting the existence of different mechanisms responsible for ICP changes. Moreover, analysis of the correlation between the parameter estimates might give information on the directions of parameter changes that have a greater impact on ICP.},

In this work, we describe the use of a novel nanofabricated gold surface, with regions of distinct topography and chemical functionalities, to solve this problem. First, nanoarrays of IgG antibodies were produced by selective immobilization in nanoholes on the surface. The smallest feature size was determined by the hole size (fwhm 90 nm) and not surface diffusion. Using holes of 300 nm diameter, we selectively addressed specific features in the array by nanopipet delivery of a functional antibody, anti-IgG. To our knowledge, this is the first example of addressing specific biologically functional features on a surface at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {1. The properties of evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) have been studied in neurons of the nucleus magnocellularis (nMAG), one of the avian cochlear nuclei which receive somatic, calyceal innervation from auditory nerve fibres. Whole-cell patch clamp techniques were used to voltage clamp visually identified neurons in brain slices. 2. EPSCs resulting from activation of single axonal inputs were on average -5.3 nA at a driving force of -25 mV. Current-voltage relationships for the peak of the EPSC were linear with a peak conductance of 211 nS. The rate of EPSC decay showed a linear increase with temperature, with a temperature coefficient (Q10) of 2.2 between 25 and 35 degrees C; in vivo (41 degrees C) the EPSC would decay in 0.2 ms. 3. The EPSC was composed of two pharmacologically and kinetically distinct components: an early phase due to non-NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors and a late phase resulting from NMDA receptors. Both components reversed near 0 mV. While both subtypes of glutamate receptor were activated by transmitter, NMDA receptors had a peak conductance at positive potentials which was only 11% of the peak non-NMDA receptor component. 4. EPSCs during trains of stimuli exhibited a progressive decrease in amplitude. The extent of depression increased with the frequency of stimulation and was reduced by drugs which prevent receptor desensitization, indicating that, in part, postsynaptic factors limit synaptic strength during repetitive synaptic activity. Additionally, the coefficient of variation of the EPSC amplitude increased during trains, consistent with presynaptic depression. 5. mEPSCs occurred randomly in the presence of tetrodotoxin and presumably correspond to transmitter quanta. These synaptic events rose (10-90%) within 100 microseconds and decayed with an exponential of 180 microseconds at 29-32 degrees C. Despite the somatic location of the synapse, mEPSCs varied widely in amplitude, suggesting differences in the quantal synaptic current at each synaptic site. The ratio of the average peak conductance of the EPSC and mEPSC gave an estimated quantal content of 103.},

abstract = {Excitatory amino acids act via receptor subtypes in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). The receptor selectively activated by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) has been best characterized using voltage-clamp and single-channel recording; the results suggest that NMDA receptors gate channels that are permeable to Na+, K+ and other monovalent cations. Various experiments suggest that Ca2+ flux is also associated with the activation of excitatory amino-acid receptors on vertebrate neurones. Whether Ca2+ enters through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels or through excitatory amino-acid-activated channels of one or more subtype is unclear. Mg2+ can be used to distinguish NMDA-receptor-activated channels from voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, because at micromolar concentrations Mg2+ has little effect on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels while it enters and blocks NMDA receptor channels. Marked differences in the potency of other divalent cations acting as Ca2+ channel blockers compared with their action as NMDA antagonists also distinguish the NMDA channel from voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. However, we now directly demonstrate that excitatory amino acids acting at NMDA receptors on spinal cord neurones increase the intracellular Ca2+ activity, measured using the indicator dye arsenazo III, and that this is the result of Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptor channels. Kainic acid (KA), which acts at another subtype of excitatory amino-acid receptor, was much less effective in triggering increases in intracellular free Ca2+.},

abstract = {In cerebellar Purkinje neurons, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission undergoes a long-lasting "rebound potentiation" after the activation of excitatory climbing fiber inputs. Rebound potentiation is triggered by the climbing-fiber-induced transient elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration and is expressed as a long-lasting increase of postsynaptic GABAA receptor sensitivity. Herein we show that inhibitors of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM-KII) signal transduction pathway effectively block the induction of rebound potentiation. These inhibitors have no effect on the once established rebound potentiation, on voltage-gated Ca2+ channel currents, or on the basal inhibitory transmission itself. Furthermore, a protein phosphatase inhibitor and the intracellularly applied CaM-KII markedly enhanced GABA-mediated currents in Purkinje neurons. Our results demonstrate that CaM-KII activation and the following phosphorylation are key steps for rebound potentiation.},

abstract = {Gap junction channels are formed by members of the connexin gene family and mediate direct intercellular communication through linked hemichannels (connexons) from each of two adjacent cells. While for most connexins, the hemichannels appear to require an apposing hemichannel to open, macroscopic currents obtained from Xenopus oocytes expressing rat Cx46 suggested that some hemichannels can be readily opened by membrane depolarization [Paul, D. L., Ebihara, L., Takemoto, L. J., Swenson, K. I. {\&} Goodenough, D. A. (1991), J. Cell Biol. 115, 1077-1089]. Here we demonstrate by single channel recording that hemichannels comprised of rat Cx46 exhibit complex voltage gating consistent with there being two distinct gating mechanisms. One mechanism partially closes Cx46 hemichannels from a fully open state, gammaopen, to a substate, gammasub, about one-third of the conductance of gammaopen; these transitions occur when the cell is depolarized to inside positive voltages, consistent with gating by transjunctional voltage in Cx46 gap junctions. The other gating mechanism closes Cx46 hemichannels to a fully closed state, gammaclosed, on hyperpolarization to inside negative voltages and has unusual characteristics; transitions between gammaclosed and gammaopen appear slow (10-20 ms), often involving several transient substates distinct from gammasub. The polarity of activation and kinetics of this latter form of gating indicate that it is the mechanism by which these hemichannels open in the cell surface membrane when unapposed by another hemichannel. Cx46 hemichannels display a substantial preference for cations over anions, yet have a large unitary conductance (approximately 300 pS) and a relatively large pore as inferred from permeability to tetraethylammonium (approximately 8.5 angstroms diameter). These hemichannels open at physiological voltages and could induce substantial cation fluxes in cells expressing Cx46.},

abstract = {1. Synaptic currents were recorded in voltage-clamped cerebellar Purkinje cells using the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. Cells were dialysed with a CsCl solution and were held at -60 or -70 mV. Inhibitory interneurones (basket and stellate cells) were stimulated using an extracellular pipette positioned in the molecular layer. Blockers of excitatory glutamatergic synapses were included in the bath solution. 2. Evoked synaptic currents were observed after a latency of 3-4 ms. The time course of synaptic currents could in most cases be fitted to a biexponential curve, with a rise time constant, tau on, of 1-3 ms and a decay time constant, tau off, of 7-13 ms. These currents were blocked by bicuculline. 3. The mean amplitude of evoked synaptic currents increased in discrete steps when the voltage applied to the stimulating pipette was increased. At each level, very prominent fluctuations of the amplitude were observed among trials. 4. Complex synaptic currents corresponding to repetitive activity of the presynaptic interneurone were occasionally observed, particularly with high intensity presynaptic stimulation. This repetitive activity could lead to bursts of synaptic currents lasting for several seconds. 5. Following a depolarizing voltage train in the postsynaptic Purkinje cell, the amplitude of evoked synaptic currents was first inhibited, and then potentiated. The inhibition was accompanied by a small but consistent increase in tau off and by no alteration in tau on. When using small intensity presynaptic stimuli, it was found that the probability of failures was greatly enhanced. The inhibitory phase lasted for about 1 min before giving way to potentiation. The potentiation returned to the control with a time to half-decay of 12.9 +/- 0.9 min. 6. The present results give further evidence to a previously proposed hypothesis that the inhibition produced by Purkinje cell depolarization is mainly presynaptic. The longer lasting potentiation, on the other hand, has most probably a postsynaptic origin. Cerebellar Purkinje cells receive inhibitory GABAergic inputs from two classes of interneurones located in the molecular layer (reviewed in Palay {\&} Chan-Palay, 1974; Ito, 1984). Basket cells are closest to the Purkinje cell layer and address their inhibitory signal primarily to the soma and to the main dendrites. Stellate cells are more externally located and have contacts with the more distal part of the dendritic arborization of Purkinje cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. The depressant actions of Mg2+ and a range of other divalent ions on synaptic excitation and on responses produced by excitatory amino acids and other putative transmitters have been investigated in hemisected isolated spinal cords of frogs and neonatal rats. Some comparative studies were also made using the rat isolated superior cervical ganglion. 2. At concentrations above 10 microM, Mg2+ selectively antagonized N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced motoneurone depolarization as recorded from ventral roots of tetrodotoxin-blocked spinal cords. Depolarization evoked by quisqualate (unaffected by 20 mM-Mg2+) was resistant to the depressant action of these ions, while depolarizations evoked by other excitant amino acids were depressed to intermediate degrees. 3. Mn2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ had qualitatively similar actions to Mg2+; Mn2+ was somewhat less potent and Co2+ and Ni2+ more potent than Mg2+. The alkaline earth metal ions, Ca2+, Sr2+ and Ba2+, had very weak Mg2+-like actions. Ca2+ and Mg2+ acted additively in depressing amino acid-induced responses. 4. Mg2+ also depressed motoneurone responses evoked by noradrenaline, substance P and carbachol in the neonatal rat isolated spinal cord. However, none of these effects were as marked as the depression of NMDA-induced responses by Mg2+ in this preparation. Mg2+ did not depress motoneurone depolarization produced by 5-HT in the rat spinal cord or the depolarizing action of GABA on primary afferent terminals of the isolated frog spinal cord. 5. At concentrations producing marked depression of NMDA-induced responses, Mg2+ also depressed synaptic transmission in spinal cords in the absence of an effect on ganglionic transmission. At the same concentrations, Mn2+, Co2+ and Ni2+ depressed synaptic transmission in both preparations. 6. From the similarity in action between Mg2+ and the D-alpha-aminoadipate group of NMDA antagonists, it is suggested that the central depressant action of low concentrations of Mg2+ involves predominantly a postsynaptically mediated interference with the action of an excitatory amino acid transmitter.},

abstract = {Neurons grown in culture die when they are exposed to high concentrations (0.1-1 mM) of the neurotransmitter L-glutamate. A similar phenomenon may occur in the mammalian brain during ischemia and other injuries that cause excessive glutamate release. Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and the consequent Ca2+ influx are thought to play a critical role in the process of neuronal toxicity. Events subsequent to the Ca2+ influx are not well understood. We have discovered that nonneuronal kidney cells expressing NMDA receptors after DNA transfection undergo cell death unless they are protected by drugs that block the NMDA receptor ion channel. Furthermore, transfected cells expressing a mutated NMDA receptor that conducts less Ca2+ are less vulnerable to cell death. In addition, we find that even though several active forms of NMDA receptors can be synthesized in these cells after transfection with different cloned subunits, not all receptor types are equally toxic. These experiments suggest that Ca2+ influx through NMDA channels may be toxic to nonneuronal cells and that the NMDA receptor expression may be the major neuron-specific component of excitotoxicity.},

abstract = {A wide variety of voltage-gated K+ channels are involved in the regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. Their heterogeneity arises in part from the large number of genes encoding different K+ channel subunits (reviewed in ref. 1). In addition, heterologous expression studies indicate that assembly of distinct subunits into heteromultimeric channels may contribute further to K+ channel diversity. A question has been whether heteromeric K+ channels actually form in vivo, and if so, whether specific combinations of subunits could account for major K+ currents identified in neurons. We present here biochemical evidence that Kv1.4 and Kv1.2, two K+ channel subunits of the Shaker subfamily, co-assemble in rat brain. The Kv1.4/Kv1.2 heteromultimer combines features of both parent subunits, resulting in an A-type K+ channel. Immunocytochemical evidence suggests that the heteromultimers are localized in axons and nerve terminals. We propose that Kv1.4/Kv1.2 heteromultimers may form the molecular basis of a presynaptic A-type K+ channel involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release.},

abstract = {Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) is a form of short-term plasticity of GABAergic synaptic transmission that is found in cerebellar Purkinje cells and hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. DSI involves the release of a calcium-dependent retrograde messenger by the somatodendritic compartment of the postsynaptic cell. Both glutamate and endogenous cannabinoids have been proposed as retrograde messenger. Here we show that, in cerebellar parasagittal slices, type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1Rs) are expressed at high levels in axons of GABAergic interneurons and in presynaptic terminals onto Purkinje cells. Application of the cannabinoid antagonist AM-251 (500 nm) leads to the abolition of the DSI of evoked currents (eIPSCs) recorded in paired recordings and to a strong reduction of the DSI of TTX-insensitive miniature events (mIPSCs) recorded from Purkinje cells. Furthermore, the CB1R agonist WIN 55-212,2 (5 microm) induces a presynaptic inhibition of synaptic currents similar to that occurring during DSI, as well as an occlusion of DSI after stimulation of Purkinje cells. Moreover, WIN 55-212,2 reduces the calcium transients evoked in presumed presynaptic varicosities by short trains of action potentials. Our results indicate that DSI is mediated by the activation of presynaptic CB1Rs and that an endogenous cannabinoid is a likely candidate retrograde messenger in this preparation. They further suggest that DSI involves distinct presynaptic modifications for eIPSCs and mIPSCs, including an inhibition of action potential-evoked calcium rises.},

Providing an efficient mechanism for dioxygen reduction on the one hand, it also acts as a redox-linked proton pump, coupling the free energy of water formation to the generation of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient to eventually drive ATP synthesis. The overall complexity of the mitochondrial enzyme is also reflected by its subunit structure and assembly pathway, whereas the diversity of the bacterial enzymes has fostered the notion of a large family of heme-copper terminal oxidases. Moreover, the successful elucidation of 3-D structures for both the mitochondrial and several bacterial oxidases has greatly helped in designing mutagenesis approaches to study functional aspects in these enzymes.},

abstract = {The depolarizing actions of N-methyl-DL-aspartate (NMA) and L-glutamate on pyramidal neurones were compared in a hippocampal slice preparation. Tetrodotoxin (1 microM) was added to the perfusion solution to suppress regenerative Na conductances. Depolarization evoked by ionophoretic application of NMA triggered slow, high-threshold regenerative spikes. These are considered to be Ca spikes since the amplitude and rate of rise could be reduced by verapamil, D-600, Co2+ and Mn2+, and increased by Ba2+. Multiple Ca-spike thresholds could be demonstrated in the same cell. In contrast, depolarizations evoked by L-glutamate only rarely triggered Ca-spikes. The minimum latency to the onset of depolarization evoked by NMA was less than 20 ms. The latency and amplitude of NMA-evoked responses were highly dependent on the position of the ionophoretic pipette; movements of the pipette by as little as 10-50 micron could markedly change the size of the response. Spatially separate hot spots for NMA and glutamate were not found. Depolarizations evoked by small to moderate ionophoretic currents of NMA were usually associated with an apparent rise in input resistance, as tested by the response to transmembrane current pulses. Ionophoresis of L-glutamate, or high NMA doses, however, usually caused a fall in input resistance. Both the depolarization and the conductance change evoked by NMA were highly voltage-dependent within the approximate range -50 to -80 mV; they could be increased by modest depolarization and reduced by hyperpolarization of the membrane. No reversal potential could be demonstrated in the hyperpolarizing direction. Rather, the NMA response approached zero asymptotically at sufficiently hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Subthreshold depolarizations and conductance changes elicited by NMA could be blocked by Co2+, Mn2+ and Cd2+, and reduced by D-600 and verapamil. These Ca2+ antagonists had little or no effect on resting membrane potential or input resistance, or on responses to L-glutamate. Ba2+ increased the amplitude of subthreshold NMA responses. Intracellular injection of Cs+ plus tetraethylammonium caused cells to fire large, prolonged (up to 15 s) Ca spikes, presumably because most K+ conductances were blocked. Under these conditions the effect of NMA was unchanged or enhanced. Raising [K+]o to 10.5 mM (from the normal 3.5 mM) caused a depolarization and fall in input resistance, but did not change the amplitude or voltage dependence of the NMA response. Reducing [Na+]o caused an initial increase, then usually a delayed decrease in the amplitude of the NMA response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Dendritic spines and filopodia display actin-based morphological plasticity. The function of this rapid motility is unknown. Its ubiquitous expression during development has led to the hypothesis that motility plays a role in synaptogenesis. We investigated this by simultaneously imaging presynaptic boutons and dendritic protrusions in acute hippocampal slices from GFP-M transgenic mice loaded with FM 1-43 followed by immunostaining. Postsynaptic motility was inversely correlated with the presence of stable synaptic contacts. Filopodia were highly motile and made transient interactions, whereas spines were less motile and had stable contacts, although they could still move together with a synaptic terminal. "Head morphing" of spines was associated with interactions with more than one presynaptic terminal. Our data indicate that filopodia motility could serve to transiently sample the surrounding neuropil, while the motility of established spines could mediate interactions with two axonal terminals. Spine "morphing" could therefore be the morphological signature for synaptic input competition in central synapses.},

abstract = {To cast light on the subunit composition of native NMDA-type glutamate receptors, four cloned subunits of the NMDA receptor have been expressed, in pairs, in Xenopus oocytes, and their single-channel properties have been measured. The conductances of the channels, and their characteristic patterns of sublevel transitions, turn out to be useful diagnostic criteria for subunit composition. The NR1-NR2A and NR1-NR2B combinations (which have identical TM2 sequences) are very similar to each other. Both have 50 pS openings and brief 40 pS sublevels (in 1 mM external Ca2+), with similar mean lifetimes and frequencies. They also show close quantitative resemblance to the channels of hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus cells and of cerebellar granule cells, except that the NR1-NR2A combination has a lower glycine sensitivity than the native channels. In contrast, the NR1-NR2C combination produces a channel with 36 pS and 19 pS conductances of similar (brief) duration; these closely resemble the 38-18 pS channels that have previously been observed in large cerebellar neurons in culture (together with 50 pS channels).},

abstract = {The K+ channel alpha-subunits Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 and the cytoplasmic beta-subunit Kvbeta2 were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and found to be colocalized at juxtaparanodes in normal adult rat sciatic nerve. After demyelination by intraneural injection of lysolecithin, and during remyelination, the subcellular distributions of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kvbeta2 were reorganized. At 6 d postinjection (dpi), axons were stripped of myelin, and K+ channels were found to be dispersed across zones that extended into both nodal and internodal regions; a few days later they were undetectable. By 10 dpi, remyelination was underway, but Kv1.1 immunoreactivity was absent at newly forming nodes of Ranvier. By 14 dpi, K+ channels were detected but were in the nodal gap between Schwann cells. By 19 dpi, most new nodes had Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kvbeta2, which precisely colocalized. However, this nodal distribution was transient. By 24 dpi, the majority of K+ channels was clustered within paranodal regions of remyelinated axons, leaving a gap that overlapped with Na+ channel immunoreactivity. Inhibition of Schwann cell proliferation delayed both remyelination and the development of the K+ channel distributions described. Conduction studies indicate that neither 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) nor tetraethylammonium alters normal nerve conduction. However, during remyelination, 4-AP profoundly increased both compound action potential amplitude and duration. The level of this effect matched closely the nodal presence of these voltage-dependent K+ channels. Our results suggest that K+ channels may have a significant effect on conduction during remyelination and that Schwann cells are important in K+ channel redistribution and clustering.},

abstract = {The relatively good transparency of biological materials in the near infrared region of the spectrum permits sufficient photon transmission through organs in situ for the monitoring of cellular events. Observations by infrared transillumination in the exposed heart and in the brain in cephalo without surgical intervention show that oxygen sufficiency for cytochrome a,a3, function, changes in tissue blood volume, and the average hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin equilibrium can be recorded effectively and in continuous fashion for research and clinical purposes. The copper atom associated with heme a3 did not respond to anoxia and may be reduced under normoxic conditions, whereas the heme-a copper was at least partially reducible.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the detection of low-level structure in images. It describes an algorithm for image segmentation at multiple scales. The detected regions are homogeneous and surrounded by closed edge contours. Previous approaches to multiscale segmentation represent an image at different scales using a scale-space. However, structure is only represented implicitly in this representation, structures at coarser scales are inherently smoothed, and the problem of structure extraction is unaddressed. This paper argues that the issues of scale selection and structure detection cannot be treated separately. A new concept of scale is presented that represents image structures at different scales, and not the image itself. This scale is integrated into a nonlinear transform which makes structure explicit in the transformed domain. Structures that are stable (locally invariant) to changes in scale are identified as being perceptually relevant. The transform can be viewed as collecting spatially distributed evidence for edges and regions, and making it available at contour locations, thereby facilitating integrated detection of edges and regions without restrictive models of geometry or homogeneity. In this sense, it performs Gestalt analysis. All scale parameters of the transform are automatically determined, and the structure of any arbitrary geometry can be identified without any smoothing, even at coarse scales.},

Convergence of a frequently used correlation dimension algorithm to a finite value does not necessarily imply an underlying deterministic model or chaos. Analysis of a recently developed family of formulas and statistics, approximate entropy (ApEn), suggests that ApEn can classify complex systems, given at least 1000 data values in diverse settings that include both deterministic chaotic and stochastic processes. The capability to discern changing complexity from such a relatively small amount of data holds promise for applications of ApEn in a variety of contexts.},

abstract = {Non-stationary effects are ubiquitous in real world data. In many settings, the observed signals are a mixture of underlying stationary and non-stationary sources that cannot be measured directly. For example, in EEG analysis, electrodes on the scalp record the activity from several sources located inside the brain, which one could only measure invasively. Discerning stationary and non-stationary contributions is an important step towards uncovering the mechanisms of the data generating system. To that end, in Stationary Subspace Analysis (SSA), the observed signal is modeled as a linear superposition of stationary and non-stationary sources, where the aim is to separate the two groups in the mixture. In this paper, we propose the first SSA algorithm that has a closed form solution. The novel method, Analytic SSA (ASSA), is more than 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art, numerically stable, and guaranteed to be optimal when the covariance between stationary and non-stationary sources is time-constant. In numerical simulations on wide range of settings, we show that our method yields superior results, even for signals with time-varying group-wise covariance. In an application to geophysical data analysis, ASSA extracts meaningful components that shed new light on the Pi 2 pulsations of the geomagnetic field.},

Measurements were made either in the frontal cortex (n = 10) during performance of cognitive tasks or in the occipital cortex (n = 6) during visual stimulation (flash-light exposure, picture observation). The typical findings during brain activation were an increase in [HbO2] and a decrease in [HbR]. We demonstrate that these findings are not due to alterations in skin blood flow. NIRS is a simple bedside technique for the assessment of hemodynamic alterations accompanying brain activation.},

abstract = {NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are generally believed to mediate exclusively postsynaptic effects at brain synapses. Here we searched for presynaptic effects of NMDA at inhibitory synapses in rat cerebellar slices. In Purkinje cells, application of NMDA enhanced the frequency of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) but not that of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs). This increase in frequency was dependent on the external Mg2+ concentration. In basket and stellate cells, NMDA induced an even larger mIPSC frequency increase than in Purkinje cells, whereas mEPSCs were again not affected. Moreover, NMDA induced an inward current in both types of interneuron, which translated into a small depolarization (approximately 10 mV for 30 microM NMDA) under current-clamp conditions. In paired recordings of connected basket cell-Purkinje cell synapses, depolarizations of 10-30 mV applied to the basket cell soma enhanced the frequency of postsynaptic mIPSCs, suggesting that somatic depolarization was partially transmitted to the terminals in the presence of tetrodotoxin. However, this effect was small and unlikely to account fully for the effects of NMDA on mIPSCs. Consistent with a small number of dendritic NMDARs, evoked EPSCs in interneurons had a remarkably small NMDA component. Evoked IPSCs at interneuron-interneuron synapses were inhibited by NMDA, and the rate of failures was increased, indicating again a presynaptic site of action. We conclude that activation of NMDARs in interneurons exerts complex presynaptic effects, and that the corresponding receptors are most likely located in the axonal domain of the cell.},

abstract = {Recently, we cloned and began to characterize a new N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunit, NR3A. Here we extend our earlier findings by showing that recombinantly expressed NR3A in COS cells is biochemically associated with both NR1 and NR2 subunits. In the oocyte or HEK 293 cell expression systems, co-injection of NR3A with NR1/NR2 subunits acts in a dominant-interfering manner, resulting in a decrease in NMDAR unitary conductance, decrease in Ca(2+) permeability, decrease in Mg(2+) sensitivity, and slight increase in mean open time compared with NR1/NR2 channels. The smaller unitary conductance channel has also been observed in primary cortical neurons cultured from wild-type rodent on postnatal day 8 (P8) and similarly found to be relatively insensitive to Mg(2+) block. Consistent with these findings, whole cell NMDA-evoked currents are larger in NR3A-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice, and this effect follows a developmental pattern similar to that of NR3A protein expression on Western blots, with peak expression at P8. Finally, a new longer splice variant of NR3A has been cloned and found to be expressed in rodent cortical neurons by single-cell RT-PCR and in situ hybridization.},

abstract = {1. Following motor nerve stimulation there is a period of greatly enhanced quantal release, called the early release period or ERP (Barrett {\&} Stevens, 1972b). Until now, measurements of the probability of quantal releases at different points in the ERP have come from experiments in which quantal output was greatly reduced, so that the time of release of individual quanta could be detected or so that the latency to the release of the first quantum could be measured. 2. A method has been developed to estimate the timing of quantal release during the ERP that can be used at much higher levels of quantal output. The assumption is made that each quantal release generates an end-plate current (EPC) that rises instantaneously and then decays exponentially. The peak amplitude of the quantal currents and the time constant for their decay are measured from miniature end-plate currents (MEPCs). Then a number of EPCs are averaged, and the times of release of the individual quanta during the ERP estimated by a simple mathematical method for deconvolution derived by Cohen, Van der Kloot {\&} Attwell (1981). 3. The deconvolution method was tested using data from preparations in high-Mg2+ low-Ca2+ solution. One test was to reconstitute the averaged EPCs from the estimated times of quantal release and the quantal currents, by using Fourier convolution. The reconstructions fit well to the originals. 4. Reconstructions were also made from averaged MEPCs which do not rise instantaneously and the estimated times of quantal release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Among the new methods, near-infrared transmission measurements may have significant advantages and complement well-established methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography. Near-infrared measurements can be very fast, comparable in speed to electrophysiological measurements, bur are better localized. We will present the demonstration of measurements of millisecond signals due to brain activity in humans following stimulation of the visual cortex. However, major unresolved questions remain about the origin of the signals observed. Optical measurements on exposed cortex in animals show that both the absorption and the scattering coefficient are affected by neural activity. Model calculations show that the signals we detected may originate from rapid changes of the scattering coefficient in a region about 1 to 2 cm below the scalp. We discuss our measurement protocol, which is based on a frequency-domain instrument, and the algorithm to separate the absorption from the scattering contribution in the overall response. Our method produces excellent separation between scattering and absorption in relatively homogeneous masses such as large muscles. The extrapolation of our measurement protocol to a complex structure such as the human head is critically evaluated.},

abstract = {The functional properties of rat homomeric alpha 1 glycine receptors were investigated using whole-cell and outside-out recording from human embryonic kidney cells transfected with rat alpha1 subunit cDNA. Whole-cell dose-response curves gave EC(50) estimates between 30 and 120 microM and a Hill slope of approximately 3.3. Single channel recordings were obtained by steady-state application of glycine (0.3, 1, or 10 microM) to outside-out patches. Single channel conductances were mostly 60-90 pS, but smaller conductances of approximately 40 pS were also seen (10% of the events) with a relative frequency that did not depend on agonist concentration. The time constants of the apparent open time distributions did not vary with agonist concentration, but short events were more frequent at low glycine concentrations. There was also evidence of a previously missed short-lived open state that was more common at lower glycine concentrations. The time constants for the different components of the burst length distributions were found to have similar values at different concentrations. Nevertheless, the mean burst length increased with increasing glycine. This was because the relative area of each burst-length component was concentration dependent and short bursts were favored at lower glycine concentrations. Durations of adjacent open and shut times were found to be strongly (negatively) correlated. Additionally, long bursts were made up of longer than average openings separated by short gaps, whereas short bursts usually consisted of single isolated short openings. The most plausible explanation for these findings is that long bursts are generated when a higher proportion of the five potential agonist binding sites on the receptor is occupied by glycine. On the basis of the concentration dependence and the intraburst structure we provide a preliminary kinetic scheme for the activation of the homomeric glycine receptor, in which any number of glycine molecules from one to five can open the channel, although not with equal efficiency.},

abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {The concept of limiting step gives the limit simplification: the whole network behaves as a single step. However, in its simplest form this idea is applicable only to the simplest linear cycles in steady states. For such the simplest cycles the nonstationary behaviour is also limited by a single step, but not the same step that limits the stationary rate. We develop a general theory of static and dynamic limitation for all linear multiscale networks. New estimates of eigenvectors for diagonally dominant matrices are used. Multiscale ensembles of reaction networks with well separated constants are introduced and typical properties of such systems are studied. For any given ordering of reaction rate constants the explicit approximation of steady state, relaxation spectrum and related eigenvectors ("modes") is presented. The obtained multiscale approximations that we call "dominant systems" are computationally cheap and robust. These dominant systems can be used for direct computation of steady states and relaxation dynamics, especially when kinetic information is incomplete, for design of experiments and mining of experimental data, and could serve as a robust first approximation in perturbation theory or for preconditioning.

abstract = {1. Initiation and propagation of action potentials evoked by extracellular synaptic stimulation was studied using simultaneous dual and triple patch pipette recordings from different locations on neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from 4-week-old rats (P26-30) at physiological temperatures. 2. Simultaneous cell-attached and whole-cell voltage recordings from the apical trunk (up to 700 microns distal to the soma) and the soma indicated that proximal synaptic stimulation (layer 4) initiated action potentials first at the soma, whereas distal stimulation (upper layer 2/3) could initiate dendritic regenerative potentials prior to somatic action potentials following stimulation at higher intensity. 3. Somatic action potentials, once initiated, propagated back into the apical dendrites in a decremented manner which was frequency dependent. The half-width of back propagating action potentials increased and their maximum rate of rise decreased with distance from the soma, with the peak of these action potentials propagating with a conduction velocity of approximately 0.5 m s-1. 4. Back-propagation of action potentials into the dendritic tree was associated with dendritic calcium electrogenesis, which was particularly prominent during bursts of somatic action potentials. 5. When dendritic regenerative potentials were evoked prior to somatic action potentials, the more distal the dendritic recording was made from the soma the longer the time between the onset of the dendritic regenerative potential relative to somatic action potential. This suggested that dendritic regenerative potentials were initiated in the distal apical dendrites, possibly in the apical tuft. 6. At any one stimulus intensity, the initiation of dendritic regenerative potentials prior to somatic action potentials could fluctuate, and was modulated by depolarizing somatic or hyperpolarizing dendritic current injection. 7. Dendritic regenerative potentials could be initiated prior to somatic action potentials by dendritic current injections used to simulate the membrane voltage change that occurs during an EPSP. Initiation of these dendritic potentials was not affected by cadmium (200 microM), but was blocked by TTX (1 microM). 8. Dendritic regenerative potentials in some experiments were initiated in isolated from somatic action potentials. The voltage change at the soma in response to these dendritic regenerative events was small and subthreshold, showing that dendritic regenerative events are strongly attenuated as they spread to the soma. 9. Simultaneous whole-cell recordings from the axon initial segment and the soma indicated that synaptic stimulation always initiated action potentials first in the axon. The further the axonal recording was made from the soma the greater the time delay between axonal and somatic action potentials, indicating a site of action potential initiation in the axon at least 30 microns distal to the soma. 10. Simultaneous whole-cell recordings from the apical dendrite, soma and axon initial segment showed that action potentials were always initiated in the axon prior to the soma, and with the same latency difference, independent of whether dendritic regenerative potentials were initiated or not. 11. It is concluded that both the apical dendrites and the axon of neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in P26-30 animals are capable of initiating regenerative potentials. Regenerative potentials initiated in dendrites, however, are significantly attenuated as they spread to the soma and axon. As a consequence, action potentials are always initiated in the axon before the soma, even when synaptic activation is intense enough to initiate dendritic regenerative potentials. Once initiated, the axonal action potentials are conducted orthogradely into the axonal arbor and retrogradely into the dendritic tree.},

abstract = {Patch-clamp recording provides an unprecedented means for study of detailed kinetics of ion channels at the single molecule level. Analysis of the recordings often begins with idealization of noisy recordings into continuous dwell-time sequences. Success of an analysis is contingent on accuracy of the idealization. I present here a statistical procedure based on hidden Markov modeling and k-means segmentation. The approach assumes a Markov scheme involving discrete conformational transitions for the kinetics of the channel and a white background noise for contamination of the observations. The idealization is sought to maximize a posteriori probability of the state sequence corresponding to the samples. The approach constitutes two fundamental steps. First, given a model, the Viterbi algorithm is applied to determine the most likely state sequence. With the resultant idealization, the model parameters are then empirically refined. The transition probabilities are calculated from the state sequences, and the current amplitudes and noise variances are determined from the ensemble means and variances of those samples belonging to the same conductance classes. The two steps are iterated until the likelihood is maximized. In practice, the algorithm converges rapidly, taking only a few iterations. Because the noise is taken into explicit account, it allows for a low signal/noise ratio, and consequently a relatively high bandwidth. The approach is applicable to data containing subconductance levels or multiple channels and permits state-dependent noises. Examples are given to elucidate its performance and practical applicability.},

The technique can measure a wide range of volumes from 10(-19) to 10(-9) liter. The cell volume, as well as the volume of small cellular structures such as lamelopodia, dendrites, processes, or microvilli, can be measured with the 2.5 x 10(-20) liter resolution. The sample does not require any preliminary preparation before cell volume measurement. Both cell volume and surface characteristics can be simultaneously and continuously assessed during relatively long experiments. The SICM method can also be used for rapid estimation of the changes in cell volume. These are important when monitoring the cell responses to different physiological stimuli.},

abstract = {In this study, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to mechanically stimulate primary osteoblasts. In response to mechanical force applied by the AFM, the indented cell increased its intracellular calcium concentration. The material properties of the cell could be estimated and the membrane strains calculated. We proceeded to validate this technique experimentally and a 20% error was found between the predicted and the measured diameter of indentation. We also determined the strain distributions within the cell that result from AFM indentation using a simple finite element model. This enabled us to formulate hypotheses as to the mechanism through which cells may sense the applied mechanical strains. Finally, we report the effect of the Poisson ratio and the cell thickness on the strain distributions. Varying the Poisson ratio did not change the order of magnitude of the strains; whereas the cellular thickness dramatically changed the order of magnitude of the cellular strains. We conclude that AFM can be used for controlled mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts and that cellular strain distributions can be computed with a good accuracy when the cell is indented in its highest part.},

abstract = {Windkessel and similar lumped models are often used to represent blood flow and pressure in systemic arteries. The windkessel model was originally developed by Stephen Hales (1733) and Otto Frank (1899) who used it to describe blood flow in the heart. In this paper we start with the onedimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations for time-dependent blood flow in a rigid vessel to derive lumped models relating flow and pressure. This is done through Laplace transform and its inversion via residue theory. Upon keeping contributions from one, two, or more residues, we derive lumped models of successively higher order. We focus on zeroth, first and second order models and relate them to electrical circuit analogs, in which current is equivalent to flow and voltage to pressure. By incorporating effects of compliance through addition of capacitors, windkessel and related lumped models are obtained. Our results show that given the radius of a blood vessel, it is possible to determine the order of the model that would be appropriate for analyzing the flow and pressure in that vessel. For instance, in small rigid vessels ( R < 0.2 cm) it is adequate to use Poiseuille's law to express the relation between flow and pressure, whereas for large vessels it might be necessary to incorporate spatial dependence by using a one-dimensional model accounting for axial variations.},

We illustrate the approach for a calculation of the catalytic rate of ammonia synthesis over a range of transition-metal catalysts. The correlation between errors in density functional theory calculations is shown to play an important role in reducing the predicted error on calculated rates. Uncertainties depend strongly on reaction conditions and catalyst material, and the relative rates between different catalysts are considerably better described than the absolute rates. We introduce an approach for incorporating uncertainty when searching for improved catalysts by evaluating the probability that a given catalyst is better than a known standard.},

abstract = {Microexplant cell cultures of fetal rat cerebellum contain essentially monolayer networks of Purkinje cells, occasional granule cells and neurons from the deep nuclei. The neurons and occasional filament-packed glial cells develop on top of a sheet of flattened, non-neuronal cells. In the absence of extrinsic input to the cerebellum and greatly reduced numbers of granule cells, the Purkinje cells develop a stunted and non-oriented dendritic arbor similar to that observed in agranular cerebella. The Purkinje cell dendritic branches, however, are spine-covered. Although the spines are not enveloped by glia and are only rarely contacted by a presynaptic bouton, most spines display a patch of electron-dense material resembling a postsynaptic membrane specialization. The Purkinje cells develop synaptic interactions among themselves and with granule cells. The ultrastructural morphology of boutons derived from both Purkinje cells and large neurons of the deep nuclei, identified after intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase, is consistent with that observed in vivo. The present study indicates that cerebellar Purkinje cells survive and differentiate in a culture system in which individual neurons are accessible for electrophysiological and morphological analyses.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

They are often justified on the basis of randomization and coarse-graining assumptions. Here instead, we derive nth-order Markov processes and the master equation as unique solutions to an inverse problem. We find that when constraints are not enough to uniquely determine the stochastic model, an nth-order Markov process emerges as the unique maximum entropy solution to this otherwise underdetermined problem. This gives a rigorous alternative for justifying such models while providing a systematic recipe for generalizing widely accepted stochastic models usually assumed to follow from the first principles.},

abstract = {We describe the extension of a computational model of blood flow and metabolism in the piglet brain to investigate changes in neonatal intracellular brain pH during hypoxia-ischemia (HI). The model is able to simulate near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements obtained from HI experiments conducted in piglets. We adopt a method of using (31)P-MRS data to estimate of intracellular pH and compare measured pH and oxygenation with their modelled counterparts. We show that both NIRS and MRS measurements are predicted well in the new version of the model.},

abstract = {According to classical concepts of physiologic control, healthy systems are self-regulated to reduce variability and maintain physiologic constancy. Contrary to the predictions of homeostasis, however, the output of a wide variety of systems, such as the normal human heartbeat, fluctuates in a complex manner, even under resting conditions. Scaling techniques adapted from statistical physics reveal the presence of long-range, power-law correlations, as part of multifractal cascades operating over a wide range of time scales. These scaling properties suggest that the nonlinear regulatory systems are operating far from equilibrium, and that maintaining constancy is not the goal of physiologic control. In contrast, for subjects at high risk of sudden death (including those with heart failure), fractal organization, along with certain nonlinear interactions, breaks down. Application of fractal analysis may provide new approaches to assessing cardiac risk and forecasting sudden cardiac death, as well as to monitoring the aging process. Similar approaches show promise in assessing other regulatory systems, such as human gait control in health and disease. Elucidating the fractal and nonlinear mechanisms involved in physiologic control and complex signaling networks is emerging as a major challenge in the postgenomic era.},

abstract = {The atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to directly image hippocampal neurons and glia. Using chemically fixed and living cells it was possible to reconstruct three-dimensional cell structure and detect sub-cellular features such as the nucleus, mitochondria and filaments. By repeatedly scanning a single living cell we observed the movement of filaments beneath the cell membrane. Furthermore, by controlling the force applied to the scanning tip, nanosurgery was performed to selectively remove cells from the culture substratum. Thus, the atomic force microscope offers the opportunity to gain three-dimensional information about living cells and to observe the behavior of cellular components by imaging through the intact cell membrane.},

abstract = {Glutamate and GABA-receptor channels were investigated in explants of rat cerebellum grown in cell culture. The patch-clamp technique was used to examine neurons under whole cell clamp and the properties of channels were derived by analysis of glutamate and GABA-evoked current noise. In addition, single channel currents activated by glutamate were recorded from isolated outside-out patches of membrane. We found evidence for at least two types of glutamate receptor-channels in cerebellar cells. Some neurons exhibited a channel of 50 pS conductance with a Lorentzian noise spectrum of 5.9 ms time constant. Single channels were readily resolved both in whole cell clamp and excised patches. Other neurons possessed low conductance channels which produced two component spectra. Estimates of the single channel conductance gave a value of about 140 fS. GABA channel noise obtained from these cells was also fitted by two component spectra which gave single channel conductance of 16 pS.},

abstract = {Data from many scientific areas often come with measurement error. Density or distribution function estimation from contaminated data and nonparametric regression with errors-in-variables are two important topics in measurement error models. In this paper, we present a new software package decon for R, which contains a collection of functions that use the deconvolution kernel methods to deal with the measurement error problems. The functions allow the errors to be either homoscedastic or heteroscedastic. To make the deconvolution estimators computationally more efficient in R, we adapt the fast Fourier transform algorithm for density estimation with error-free data to the deconvolution kernel estimation. We discuss the practical selection of the smoothing parameter in deconvolution methods and illustrate the use of the package through both simulated and real examples.},

abstract = {LibSBML is an application programming interface library for reading, writing, manipulating and validating content expressed in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format. It is written in ISO C and C++, provides language bindings for Common Lisp, Java, Python, Perl, MATLAB and Octave, and includes many features that facilitate adoption and use of both SBML and the library. Developers can embed libSBML in their applications, saving themselves the work of implementing their own SBML parsing, manipulation and validation software.

LibSBML 3 was released in August 2007. Source code, binaries and documentation are freely available under LGPL open-source terms from http://sbml.org/software/libsbml.},

abstract = {One of the earliest morphological changes occurring in apop- tosis is cell shrinkage associated with an increased efflux of K+ and Cl- ions. Block of K+ or Cl- channels prevents cell shrinkage and death. Recently, we found evidences for the activation of a voltage- dependent anion channel in the plasma membrane (pl-VDAC) of a hippocampal cell line undergoing apoptosis. Nothing is known on pl-VDAC in apoptotic cell death of neural cells at different stages of differentiation. We have addressed this issue in primary cultures of differentiated hippocampal neurons and embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs). In control hippocampal neurons, pl-VDAC is closed but acts as an NADH-ferricyanide reductase, while in apoptotic neurons, pl-VDAC is opened and the enzymatic activity is increased. Anti-VDAC antibodies block pl-VDAC and prevent apoptosis, as well as the increase in enzymatic activity. Conversely, in NSCs, pl-VDAC is scarcely seen and there is no NADH- ferricyanide reductase activity. In agreement, anti-VDAC antibodies do not affect the apoptotic process. Instead, we find activation of a Na+ channel that has low voltage dependency, a conductance of 26 pS, and is blocked by amiloride, which also prevents apoptosis. Thus, it appears that activation of pl-VDAC during apoptosis is a critical event in differentiated neurons, but not in NSCs.},

abstract = {The temporal and spatial progression of DNA replication in interphase nuclei of eukaryotic cells has been investigated. Application of a recently developed technique for the immunofluorescence double staining of cell nuclei labelled first with iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) and subsequently with chlorodeoxyuridine (CldUrd) allows the visualization of two replication patterns in the same nucleus originating from two different periods of the S-phase. We have analysed changes in the three-dimensional replication patterns during the S-phase. To record dual colour three-dimensional images of doubly stained nuclei, a confocal microscope is used. This CSLM is equipped with a specific laser/filter combination to collect both fluorescence signals (FITC and Texas Red) in a single scan, thus precluding pixel shift between the images. A method for the quantitative evaluation of the degree of overlap between DNA regions replicated in two different periods of the S-phase is applied. The results confirm the generally accepted theory that DNA is replicated coordinately in a specific temporal order during the S-phase. The replication time of a DNA domain (i.e. the time between initiation and termination of DNA replication within a domain) at the very beginning of the S-phase was known to be one hour (Nakamura et al., 1986). Our observations show that in the rest of the S-phase, the replication time of a DNA region is also about one hour. We conclude that replicon clusters located in the same region are replicated in the same relatively short period of time. After this period there is no unreplicated DNA left in this region.},

abstract = {A method is presented that allows one to estimate transmitter release rates from fluctuations of postsynaptic current records under conditions of stationary or slowly varying release. For experimental applications, we used the calyx of Held, a glutamatergic synapse, in which "residual current," i.e., current attributable to residual glutamate in the synaptic cleft, is present. For a characterization of synaptic transmission, several postsynaptic parameters, such as the mean amplitude of the miniature postsynaptic current and an apparent single channel conductance, have to be known. These were obtained by evaluating variance and two more higher moments of the current fluctuations. In agreement with Fesce et al. (1986), we found both by simulations and by analyzing experimental records that high-pass filtering of postsynaptic currents renders the estimates remarkably tolerant against nonstationarities. We also found that release rates and postsynaptic parameters can be reliably obtained when release rates are low ( approximately 10 events/msec). Furthermore, during a long-lasting stimulus, the transmitter release at the calyx of Held was found to decay to a low, stationary rate of 10 events/msec after depletion of the "releasable pool" of synaptic vesicles. This stationary release rate is compatible with the expected rate of recruitment of new vesicles to the release-ready pool of vesicles. MiniatureEPSC (mEPSC) size is estimated to be similar to the value of spontaneously occurring mEPSC under this condition.},

abstract = {Sparse kernel methods like support vector machines (SVM) have been applied with great success to classification and (standard) regression settings. Existing support vector classification and regression techniques however are not suitable for partly censored survival data, which are typically analysed using Cox's proportional hazards model. As the partial likelihood of the proportional hazards model only depends on the covariates through inner products, it can be 'kernelized'. The kernelized proportional hazards model however yields a solution that is dense, i.e. the solution depends on all observations. One of the key features of an SVM is that it yields a sparse solution, depending only on a small fraction of the training data. We propose two methods. One is based on a geometric idea, where-akin to support vector classification-the margin between the failed observation and the observations currently at risk is maximised. The other approach is based on obtaining a sparse model by adding observations one after another akin to the Import Vector Machine (IVM). Data examples studied suggest that both methods can outperform competing approaches.

abstract = {Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) provides an effective approach for modeling single channel kinetics. Standard HMM is based on Baum's reestimation. As applied to single channel currents, the algorithm has the inability to optimize the rate constants directly. We present here an alternative approach by considering the problem as a general optimization problem. The quasi-Newton method is used for searching the likelihood surface. The analytical derivatives of the likelihood function are derived, thereby maximizing the efficiency of the optimization. Because the rate constants are optimized directly, the approach has advantages such as the allowance for model constraints and the ability to simultaneously fit multiple data sets obtained at different experimental conditions. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the algorithm. Comparisons with Baum's reestimation suggest that the approach has a superior convergence speed when the likelihood surface is poorly defined due to, for example, a low signal-to-noise ratio or the aggregation of multiple states having identical conductances.},

abstract = {Glutamate released at synapses in the CA1 region of the hippocampus escapes the synaptic cleft and activates extrasynaptic targets; it also may "spill over" into neighboring synapses and activate receptors there. Glutamate transporters in glial membranes restrict extrasynaptic diffusion, but it is unclear whether neuronal glutamate transporters also limit transmitter diffusion and receptor activation by spillover. I examined the effects of a low-affinity competitive NMDA receptor antagonist on EPSCs in acute hippocampal slices to distinguish receptors activated within active synapses from those activated by spillover. Glutamate spillover is observed between Schaffer collateral fiber synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells only when transporters in the postsynaptic neuron are inhibited. Because glutamate transporters operate most effectively at negative membrane potentials, these results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors by spillover may depend on postsynaptic activity.},

abstract = {Abnormal heart rate characteristics of reduced variability and transient decelerations are present early in the course of neonatal sepsis. To investigate the dynamics, we calculated sample entropy, a similar but less biased measure than the popular approximate entropy. Both calculate the probability that epochs of window length m that are similar within a tolerance r remain similar at the next point. We studied 89 consecutive admissions to a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit, among whom there were 21 episodes of sepsis, and we performed numerical simulations. We addressed the fundamental issues of optimal selection of m and r and the impact of missing data. The major findings are that entropy falls before clinical signs of neonatal sepsis and that missing points are well tolerated. The major mechanism, surprisingly, is unrelated to the regularity of the data: entropy estimates inevitably fall in any record with spikes. We propose more informed selection of parameters and reexamination of studies where approximate entropy was interpreted solely as a regularity measure.},

abstract = { Computational models are increasingly used to understand and predict complex biological phenomena. These models contain many unknown parameters, at least some of which are difficult to measure directly, and instead are estimated by fitting to time-course data. Previous work has suggested that even with precise data sets, many parameters are unknowable by trajectory measurements. We examined this question in the context of a pathway model of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and neuronal growth factor (NGF) signaling. Computationally, we examined a palette of experimental perturbations that included different doses of EGF and NGF as well as single and multiple gene knockdowns and overexpressions. While no single experiment could accurately estimate all of the parameters, experimental design methodology identified a set of five complementary experiments that could. These results suggest optimism for the prospects for calibrating even large models, that the success of parameter estimation is intimately linked to the experimental perturbations used, and that experimental design methodology is important for parameter fitting of biological models and likely for the accuracy that can be expected from them.},

The method is based on the local application of mechanical vibration directly on the chosen site of a slice and does not require the enzymatic pretreatment of the tissue. The application of the method to the isolation of the CA1 pyramidal neurones from rat hippocampal slices has been shown to be highly efficient. The characteristic morphology and sensitivity to N-methyl-D-aspartate and other substances of liberated cells are maintained. Clearly, this method should be attractive in patch-clamp studies of individual cells.},

Quantitative time-lapse fluorescence imaging was employed in combination with rapid superfusion techniques to study the dynamics of synaptic vesicles within single boutons. This approach enabled us to measure exocytosis and to analyze the kinetics of endocytosis and the preparation of endocytosed vesicles for re-release (repriming). Our measurements indicate that under sustained membrane depolarization, endocytosis persists much longer than exocytosis, with a t1/2 approximately 60 s (approximately 24 degrees C); once internalized, vesicles become reavailable for exocytosis in approximately 30 s. Furthermore, we have shown that endocytosis is not dependent on membrane potential and, unlike exocytosis, that it is independent of extracellular Ca2+.},

abstract = {1. EPSCs were recorded under whole-cell voltage clamp at room temperature from Purkinje cells in slices of cerebellum from 12- to 14-day-old rats. EPSCs from individual climbing fibre (CF) inputs were identified on the basis of their large size, paired-pulse depression and all-or-none appearance in response to a graded stimulus. 2. Synaptic transmission was investigated over a wide range of experimentally imposed release probabilities by analysing fluctuations in the peak of the EPSC. Release probability was manipulated by altering the extracellular [Ca2+] and [Mg2+]. Quantal parameters were estimated from plots of coefficient of variation (CV) or variance against mean conductance by fitting a multinomial model that incorporated both spatial variation in quantal size and non-uniform release probability. This 'multiple-probability fluctuation' (MPF) analysis gave an estimate of 510 +/- 50 for the number of functional release sites (N) and a quantal size (q) of 0.5 +/- 0.03 nS (n = 6). 3. Control experiments, and simulations examining the effects of non-uniform release probability, indicate that MPF analysis provides a reliable estimate of quantal parameters. Direct measurement of quantal amplitudes in the presence of 5 mM Sr2+, which gave asynchronous release, yielded distributions with a mean quantal size of 0.55 +/- 0.01 nS and a CV of 0.37 +/- 0.01 (n = 4). Similar estimates of q were obtained in 2 mM Ca2+ when release probability was lowered with the calcium channel blocker Cd2+. The non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 1 microM) reduced both the evoked current and the quantal size (estimated with MPF analysis) to a similar degree, but did not affect the estimate of N. 4. We used MPF analysis to identify those quantal parameters that change during frequency-dependent depression at climbing fibre-Purkinje cell synaptic connections. At low stimulation frequencies, the mean release probability (pr) was unusually high (0.90 +/- 0.03 at 0.033 Hz, n = 5), but as the frequency of stimulation was increased, pr fell dramatically (0.02 +/- 0.01 at 10 Hz, n = 4) with no apparent change in either q or N. This indicates that the observed 50-fold depression in EPSC amplitude is presynaptic in origin. 5. Presynaptic frequency-dependent depression was investigated with double-pulse and multiple-pulse protocols. EPSC recovery, following simultaneous release at practically all sites, was slow, being well fitted by the sum of two exponential functions (time constants of 0.35 +/- 0.09 and 3.2 +/- 0.4 s, n = 5). EPSC recovery following sustained stimulation was even slower. We propose that presynaptic depression at CF synapses reflects a slow recovery of release probability following release of each quantum of transmitter. 6. The large number of functional release sites, relatively large quantal size, and unusual dynamics of transmitter release at the CF synapse appear specialized to ensure highly reliable olivocerebellar transmission at low frequencies but to limit transmission at higher frequencies.},

abstract = {The coupling between cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and blood flow (CBF) in response to visual stimulation was evaluated by means of a model of oxygen delivery. The model predicted a nonlinear relationship between stimulus-evoked changes of oxygen consumption and blood flow. The magnitude of the CMRO2/CBF ratio index (IO2) was used to indicate the degree of flow-metabolism coupling prevailing in specific areas of the brain during physiological stimulation. Therefore, the index provided a measure of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance contrast. To evaluate the changes of IO2 in response to visual stimulation, the model was applied to the effect of a changing flicker rate of a visual stimulus on the magnitudes of CBF, CMRO2, and oxygen diffusion capacity, in the human brain. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure the CBF and the CMRO2 in 12 healthy volunteers who viewed a cross-hair (baseline) or a yellow-blue annular checkerboard reversing at frequencies of 1, 4, or 8 Hz. The magnitude of CBF in the primary visual cortex increased as a function of the checkerboard reversal rate and reached a maximum at the frequency of 8 Hz (z=16.0), while the magnitude of CMRO2 reached a maximum at 4 Hz (z=4.0). Therefore, the calculated IO2 was lower at 8 Hz than at 1 and 4 Hz, in contrast to the oxidative metabolic rate that reached its maximum at 4 Hz. The model explained the increase of oxygen consumption as the combined effect of increased blood flow and increased oxygen diffusion capacity in the region of visual activation.},

abstract = {The sensitivity to GABA of Purkinje cells in thin cerebellar slices was examined by recording either spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents or ionic currents elicited by local GABA applications. The effects of Ca2+ entry induced by depolarizing voltage pulses were opposite for the two types of currents. Currents due to exogenous GABA applications were increased by a train of voltage pulses. This potentiation was transient with an average half recovery period of 3.7 min. Spontaneous synaptic currents were reduced by depolarizing voltage pulses, with a half recovery time of about 20 s. The inhibition was largely explained by a decrease of the frequency of synaptic events, suggesting that the primary location of the effect was presynaptic. Thus, a Ca2+ rise increases the sensitivity of Purkinje cells to GABA and induces a retrograde inhibition of presynaptic terminals. The latter effect may be due to a diffusible Ca2(+)-dependent messenger.},

The probe of the SICM is an electrolyte-filled micropipette. The flow of ions through the opening of the pipette is blocked at short distances between the probe and the surface, thus, limiting the ion conductance. A feedback mechanism can be used to maintain a given conductance and in turn determine the distance to the surface. The SICM can also sample and image the local ion currents above the surfaces. To illustrate its potential for imaging ion currents through channels in membranes, a topographic image of a membrane filter with 0.80-micrometer pores and an image of the ion currents flowing through such pores are presented.},

abstract = {Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) are pore-forming proteins (porins) that form the major pathway for movement of adenine nucleotides through the outer mitochondrial membrane. Electrophysiological studies indicate that VDAC-like channel activity is also prevalent in the cell membranes of many mammalian cells. However, the multitopological localization of porins outside the mitochondrion has remained an extremely controversial issue. Herein, we show that usage of two alternative first exons of the murine VDAC-1 gene leads to expression of two porins differing within their N termini. One porin (plasmalemmal VDAC-1) harboring a hydrophobic leader peptide is primarily targeted through the Golgi apparatus to the cell membrane. In contrast, the second isoform lacking the N-terminal leader (mitochondrial VDAC-1) is translocated more efficiently into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Thus, our data provide unique genetic evidence in favor of a multitopological localization of a mitochondrial porin.},

abstract = {The ion channels located on the cell fine structures play an important role in the physiological functions of cell membrane. However, it is impossible to achieve precise positioning on the nanometer scale cellular microstructures by conventional patch-clamp technique, due to the 200 nm resolution limit of optical microscope. To solve this problem, we have established a high-resolution patch-clamp technique, which combined commercial scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) and patch-clamp recording through a nanopipette probe, based on SICM feedback control. MDCK cells were used as observation object to test the capability of the technique. Firstly, a feedback controlled SICM nanopipette (approximately 150 MOmega) non-contactly scanned over a selected area of living MDCK cells monolayer to obtain high-resolution topographic images of microvilli and tight-junction microstructures on the MDCK cells monolayer. Secondly, the same nanopipette was non-contactly moved and precisely positioned over the microvilli or tight-junction microstructure under SICM feedback control. Finally, the SICM feedback control was switched off, the nanopipette slowly contacted with the cell membrane to get a patch-clamp giga-ohm sealing in the cell-attached patch-clamp configuration, and then performed ion channel recording as a normal patch-clamp electrode. The ion channel recordings showed that ion channels of microvilli microstructure opened at pipette holding potential of -100, -60, -40, 0, +40, +60, +100 mV (n=11). However, the opening of ion channels of tight-junction microstructure was not detected at pipette holding potential of -100, -40, 0, +40, +100 mV (n=9). These results suggest that our high-resolution patch-clamp technique can achieve accurate nanopipette positioning and nanometer scale high-resolution patch-clamp recording, which may provide a powerful tool to study the spatial distribution and functions of ion channel in the nanometer scale microstructures of living biological samples.},

abstract = {In the field of ligand-gated ion channels, recent developments, both in the knowledge of structure and in the measurement of function at the single-channel level, have allowed a sensible start to be made on understanding the relationship between structure and function in these proteins. In this review, the cases of glycine, nicotinic ACh and glutamate receptors are compared and contrasted, and problems such as how binding of agonist causes the channel to open, and why partial agonists are partial, are considered. Some observations, both structural and functional, suggest that more attention needs to be paid to conformational changes that occur before the channel opens. Such changes might account for the interaction found between subunits of the glycine receptor while it is still shut and, perhaps, the agonist-dependent structural changes seen in AMPA receptors. They might also complicate our understanding of the binding-gating problem.},

abstract = {A stochastic theory of channel-gating transitions is developed for a stationary system with many channels, with applications to patch-clamp single-channel experiments. Exact probability density and distribution functions for closed times, open times, and first transit times in an N-channel system are obtained in terms of N and the solutions for a one-channel system. Once N is determined, the expressions derived here can be used to analyze data records that are crowded by many channel openings and where multilevel events are common. The three-state model is treated as a specific example. Computer simulations of three-state models indicate that the equations derived here can be used to recover useful information from crowded single-channel current records. The simulations also revealed some of the limitations to the usefulness of these equations. The probability that a channel that has not opened is in a particular closed state was examined as a function of time. This analysis led to a useful limit where the distribution of unopened channels between various closed states is constant in time. This limit simplifies the mathematical treatment of closed-time probabilities, and provides a general method for the analysis of many-channel systems when channels open infrequently.},

abstract = {Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive technique which can be used to investigate cerebral haemodynamics and oxygenation with high temporal resolution. When combined with measures of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF), it has the potential to provide information about oxygen delivery, utilization and metabolism. However, the interpretation of experimental results is complex. Measured NIRS signals reflect both scalp and cerebral haemodynamics and are influenced by many factors. The relationship between Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) and CBF has been widely investigated and it central to cerebral autoregulation. Changes in arterial blood gas levels have a significant effect on ABP and CBF and these relationships have been quantified previously. The relationship between ABP and NIRS signals, however, has not been fully characterized. In this paper, we thus investigate the influence of changes in arterial blood gas levels both experimentally and theoretically, using an extended mathematical model of cerebral blood flow and metabolism, in terms of the phase angle at 0.1 Hz. The autoregulation response is found to be strongly dependent upon the carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressure but much less so upon changes in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). The results for phase angle sensitivity to CO2 show good agreement between experimental and theory, but a poorer agreement is found for the sensitivity to SaO2.},

The technique can measure rapid changes in cell height from 10 nm to several micrometers, with millisecond time resolution. This has been demonstrated on the extreme case of a contracting cardiac myocyte. By combining this method with laser confocal microscopy, it was possible to simultaneously measure the nanometric motion of the cardiac myocyte, and the local calcium concentration just under the cell membrane. Despite large cellular movement, simultaneous tracking of the changes in cell height and measurement of the intracellular Ca2+ near the cell surface is possible while retaining the cell functionality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, including signal processing, face recognition and text mining. Recent applications of NMF in bioinformatics have demonstrated its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays. Developments in NMF theory and applications have resulted in a variety of algorithms and methods. However, most NMF implementations have been on commercial platforms, while those that are freely available typically require programming skills. This limits their use by the wider research community.

RESULTS:Our objective is to provide the bioinformatics community with an open-source, easy-to-use and unified interface to standard NMF algorithms, as well as with a simple framework to help implement and test new NMF methods. For that purpose, we have developed a package for the R/BioConductor platform. The package ports public code to R, and is structured to enable users to easily modify and/or add algorithms. It includes a number of published NMF algorithms and initialization methods and facilitates the combination of these to produce new NMF strategies. Commonly used benchmark data and visualization methods are provided to help in the comparison and interpretation of the results.

CONCLUSIONS:The NMF package helps realize the potential of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, especially in bioinformatics, providing easy access to methods that have already yielded new insights in many applications. Documentation, source code and sample data are available from CRAN.},

abstract = {The blind source separation problem is to extract the underlying source signals from a set of linear mixtures, where the mixing matrix is unknown. This situation is common in acoustics, radio, medical signal and image processing, hyperspectral imaging, and other areas. We suggest a two-stage separation process: a priori selection of a possibly overcomplete signal dictionary (for instance, a wavelet frame or a learned dictionary) in which the sources are assumed to be sparsely representable, followed by unmixing the sources by exploiting the their sparse representability. We consider the general case of more sources than mixtures, but also derive a more efficient algorithm in the case of a nonovercomplete dictionary and an equal numbers of sources and mixtures. Experiments with artificial signals and musical sounds demonstrate significantly better separation than other known techniques.},

abstract = {In six anaesthetised and ventilated dogs the CSF pulse pressure was compared with the volume-pressure response (VPR) during continuous inflation of an extradural balloon. Both pulse pressure and VPR increased linearly with the ventricular fluid pressure (VFP) up to a mean VFP of 60 mmHg. At this pressure a breakpoint occurred above which the CSF pulse pressure showed a steeper linear increase, while the VPR remained constant. It is suggested that the breakpoint is related to failure of autoregulation, and that in non-autoregulating patients the CSF pulse pressure is a better parameter of the clinical state than the VPR.},

abstract = {Paired tight-seal whole-cell recordings were obtained from neighboring Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Under voltage clamp, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents resulted from the activity of GABAergic interneurons, stellate and basket cells. Up to 80% of inhibitory postsynaptic currents in paired recordings were in register. This correlation was not affected by antagonists of glutamate receptors, faded with distance, and was abolished by tetrodotoxin. Earlier work showed that voltage-gated Ca2+ entry into a Purkinje cell elicits a transient presynaptic inhibition of inhibitory postsynaptic currents. It is now shown that this inhibition is not restricted to the stimulated cell, but that it is transmitted to its neighbors. The results indicate that Purkinje cells exchange information by an unconventional mechanism involving retrograde control of inhibitory synapses.},

A prominent outgrowth of small granule cells, which did not uptake GABA, was observed only on the PL/laminin substratum. The granule cells showed the following sequence of events: (1) Many polygonal undifferentiated cells migrated out from the microexplants. These blast cells differentiated into small bipolar neurons with long fine neurites which extended radially from the explants. (2) These cells then changed their orientation perpendicular to their radial neurites, by protruding a short process from the cell body at right angles. (3) Finally, cell bodies of these granule cells adhered to each other to form cell aggregates. Quantitative labelings by bromodeoxyuridine revealed that there were less mitotic cells in explants from the later postnatal cerebellar compared to the earlier postnatal ones. Anti-MAP2 immunoreactivity was localized in short perpendicular processes of the aggregated granule cells. Thus, this unique cell behavior exhibited on the PL/laminin substratum provides the first defined experimental system for studying the granule cell differentiation in vitro.},

abstract = {A mathematical model of blood flow through the circle of Willis was developed, within a linear framework. Comprehensive analytical solutions, including a remarkably small number of parameters, were derived in the cases of obstructive lesions of extracranial carotid arteries. The influence of these lesions and the role of anterior and posterior communicating arteries on the blood pressure at the entry of the cerebral territories were quantified and analyzed emphasizing that the responses of the system of Willis to obstructive carotid lesions are extremely varied, depending on the communicating artery anatomy. Comparison with numerical results obtained by using a non-linear model showed no physiologically significant differences. Such a model might be an essential tool for an accurate assessment of the cerebral hemodynamics in carotid diseases.},

abstract = {The effects of gonadal steroid hormones on dendritic spines were studied in hippocampal neurons that were dissociated and grown in culture for 2-3 weeks. Exposure to estradiol caused up to a twofold increase in dendritic spine density in these neurons. The effect of estradiol was stereospecific and blocked by the steroid antagonist tamoxifen. The estradiol-induced rise in spine density was blocked by the NMDA antagonist APV, but not by the AMPA/KA antagonist DNQX. The estradiol-induced rise in spine density was blocked by the serine/threonine kinase inhibitor H7, but not by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genestein, and was partially mimicked by PMA, an activator of protein kinase C. Estradiol also caused an increase in the fluorescence intensity of synaptophysin-immunoreactive terminals, corresponding to presynaptic boutons. Finally, estradiol caused a rise in [Ca]i reactivity of the cultured neurons to topical application of glutamate. These studies are the first to examine receptor and second messenger regulation of dendritic spines, and they illustrate the viability of cultured neurons as a powerful test system to address issues related to the regulation of dendritic spine maturation.},

abstract = {The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM) are scanning probe microscopes capable of resolving surface detail down to the atomic level. The potential of these microscopes for revealing subtle details of structure is illustrated by atomic resolution images including graphite, an organic conductor, an insulating layered compound, and individual adsorbed oxygen atoms on a semiconductor. Application of the STM for imaging biological materials directly has been hampered by the poor electron conductivity of most biological samples. The use of thin conductive metal coatings and replicas has made it possible to image some biological samples, as indicated by recently obtained images of a recA-DNA complex, a phospholipid bilayer, and an enzyme crystal. The potential of the AFM, which does not require a conductive sample, is shown with molecular resolution images of a nonconducting organic monolayer and an amino acid crystal that reveals individual methyl groups on the ends of the amino acids. Applications of these new microscopes to technology are demonstrated with images of an optical disk stamper, a diffraction grating, a thin-film magnetic recording head, and a diamond cutting tool. The STM has even been used to improve the quality of diffraction gratings and magnetic recording heads.},

abstract = {The primary function of the presynaptic nerve terminal is to release transmitter quanta and thus activate the postsynaptic target cell. In almost every step leading to the release of transmitter quanta, there is a substantial involvement of ion channels. In this review, the multitude of ion channels in the presynaptic terminal are surveyed. There are at least 12 different major categories of ion channels representing several tens of different ion channel types; the number of different ion channel molecules at presynaptic nerve terminals is many hundreds. We describe the different ion channel molecules at the surface membrane and inside the nerve terminal in the context of their possible role in the process of transmitter release. Frequently, a number of different ion channel molecules, with the same basic function, are present at the same nerve terminal. This is especially evident in the cases of calcium channels and potassium channels. This abundance of ion channels allows for a physiological and pharmacological fine tuning of the process of transmitter release and thus of synaptic transmission.},

abstract = {The responses of vertebrate neurones to glutamate involve at least three receptor types. One of these, the NMDA receptor (so called because of its specific activation by N-methyl-D-aspartate), induces responses presenting a peculiar voltage sensitivity. Above resting potential, the current induced by a given dose of glutamate (or NMDA) increases when the cell is depolarized. This is contrary to what is observed at classical excitatory synapses, and recalls the properties of 'regenerative' systems like the Na+ conductance of the action potential. Indeed, recent studies of L-glutamate, L-aspartate and NMDA-induced currents have indicated that the current-voltage (I-V) relationship can show a region of 'negative conductance' and that the application of these agonists can lead to a regenerative depolarization. Furthermore, the NMDA response is greatly potentiated by reducing the extracellular Mg2+ concentration [( Mg2+]o) below the physiological level (approximately 1 mM). By analysing the responses of mouse central neurones to glutamate using the patch-clamp technique, we have now found a link between voltage sensitivity and Mg2+ sensitivity. In Mg2+-free solutions, L-glutamate, L-aspartate and NMDA open cation channels, the properties of which are voltage independent. In the presence of Mg2+, the single-channel currents measured at resting potential are chopped in bursts and the probability of opening of the channels is reduced. Both effects increase steeply with hyperpolarization, thereby accounting for the negative slope of the I-V relationship of the glutamate response. Thus, the voltage dependence of the NMDA receptor-linked conductance appears to be a consequence of the voltage dependence of the Mg2+ block and its interpretation does not require the implication of an intramembrane voltage-dependent 'gate'.},

abstract = {1. The confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) was used in conjunction with the calcium indicator dye Fluo-3 to record changes in free intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in cultured hippocampal neurons in response to superfusion of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). 2. NMDA caused a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i in all parts of the neuron. The rise in [Ca2+]i was dependent on activation of an NMDA receptor, was enhanced by the removal of Mg2+ and addition of glycine to the superfusion medium, and was dependent on normal [Ca2+]o. 3. The rise of [Ca2+]i was seen first near the membrane. A wave of elevated [Ca2+]i moved centripetally at a rate of 117 microns/s. 4. Dantrolene pre-incubation caused a significant reduction in the efficacy of the NMDA-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, indicating that at least part of the rise is caused by intracellular release of calcium. 5. The replacement of calcium by barium caused a reduction in the response to NMDA, but a significant response was still present in these cells, supporting the assumption that NMDA causes release of calcium from intracellular stores. 6. The removal of sodium from the superfusion medium prolonged the [Ca2+]i rise in response to NMDA indicating that the Na-Ca antiporter is instrumental in reducing [Ca2+]i. 7. These studies demonstrate the multiplicity of regulating mechanisms of [Ca2+]i following activation of NMDA receptors.},

abstract = {The fluorescent dyes FM1-43 and RH414 label motor nerve terminals in an activity-dependent fashion that involves dye uptake by synaptic vesicles that are recycling. This allows optical monitoring of vesicle recycling in living nerve terminals to determine how recycled vesicles reenter the vesicle pool. The results suggest that recycled vesicles mix with the pool morphologically and functionally. One complete cycle of release of transmitter, recycling of a vesicle, and rerelease of transmitter appears to take about 1 minute.},

abstract = {A large conductance (∼300 picosiemens) channel (LCC) of unknown molecular identity, activated by Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, particularly when augmented by caffeine, has been described previously in isolated cardiac myocytes. A potential candidate for this channel is pannexin 1 (Panx1), which has been shown to form large ion channels when expressed in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. Panx1 function is implicated in ATP-mediated auto-/paracrine signaling, and a crucial role in several cell death pathways has been suggested. Here, we demonstrate that after culturing for 4 days LCC activity is no longer detected in myocytes but can be rescued by adenoviral gene transfer of Panx1. Endogenous LCCs and those related to expression of Panx1 share key pharmacological properties previously used for identifying and characterizing Panx1 channels. These data demonstrate that Panx1 constitutes the LCC of cardiac myocytes. Sporadic openings of single Panx1 channels in the absence of Ca(2+) release can trigger action potentials, suggesting that Panx1 channels potentially promote arrhythmogenic activities.},

abstract = {The instantaneous noise-free linear mixing model in independent component analysis is largely a solved problem under the usual assumption of independent nongaussian sources and full column rank mixing matrix. However, with some prior information on the sources, like positivity, new analysis and perhaps simplified solution methods may yet become possible. In this letter, we consider the task of independent component analysis when the independent sources are known to be nonnegative and well grounded, which means that they have a nonzero pdf in the region of zero. It can be shown that in this case, the solution method is basically very simple: an orthogonal rotation of the whitened observation vector into nonnegative outputs will give a positive permutation of the original sources. We propose a cost function whose minimum coincides with nonnegativity and derive the gradient algorithm under the whitening constraint, under which the separating matrix is orthogonal. We further prove that in the Stiefel manifold of orthogonal matrices, the cost function is a Lyapunov function for the matrix gradient flow, implying global convergence. Thus, this algorithm is guaranteed to find the nonnegative well-grounded independent sources. The analysis is complemented by a numerical simulation, which illustrates the algorithm.},

Following the discovery of numerous sites of phosphorylation on ligand-gated ion channel proteins, recent studies have demonstrated that neurotransmitter-induced activation of serine/threonine, tyrosine and other kinases can result in the modulation of glutamate, type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) and glycine receptors. These findings may have important consequences for our understanding of synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability.},

abstract = {1. A new form of synaptic depression of excitatory synaptic transmission was observed when making voltage-clamp recordings from large presynaptic terminals, the calyces of Held and postsynaptic cells, the principal cells of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), in slices of the rat auditory brainstem. 2. A short (100 ms) depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to 0 mV reduced the amplitude of the EPSCs by 35 +/- 5 % (n = 7), measured at 10 ms following the depolarization. Recovery occurred within 0.5 s. 3. The reduction of the EPSCs was most probably due to reduced presynaptic calcium influx, since postsynaptic depolarization reduced presynaptic calcium or barium currents. Conversely, presynaptic depolarization also reduced postsynaptic calcium or barium influx, under conditions where transmitter release was minimal. 4. The calcium currents and the postsynaptic depolarization-induced suppression of synaptic transmission recovered with a similar time course, suggesting that this form of synaptic depression was, most probably, due to depletion of Ca2+ in the synaptic cleft. 5. We conclude that when the Ca2+ influx into the pre- or postsynaptic cell is large, extracellular Ca2+ is depleted. Under these conditions, the Ca2+ concentration in the synaptic cleft is a sensitive indicator of the level of synaptic activity. However, the synaptic cleft is less sensitive to Ca2+ depletion than predicted from its estimated volume.},

abstract = {Activations of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor by glutamate were studied in outside-out patches from CA1 cells in rat hippocampal slices. Very low glutamate concentrations (20-100 nM) were used so that individual receptor activations would be well separated. The shut-time distribution contained at least five components, only the longest component being obviously concentration dependent. The three briefest shut-time components had time constants of 56 microseconds, 0.68 ms and 10.1 ms; all of these were independent of glutamate concentration. An individual activation of the receptor therefore produces a long cluster of channel openings that contains longer gaps than have been reported for receptor activations by other fast neurotransmitters. In addition, (i) some activations may contain still longer (mean 78 ms) shut periods generating 'super clusters', and (ii) a significant amount of NMDA current may be carried by prolonged ('high P(open)') periods during which the channel is open for most of the time. Such periods occur intermittently even at these very low glutamate concentrations. It is suggested that the slow time course of the NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents may be determined mainly by the channel activation kinetics.},

abstract = {A dynamic computer model of oxidative phosphorylation in oxidative mammalian skeletal muscle was developed. The previously published model of oxidative phosphorylation in isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria was extended by incorporation of the creatine kinase system (creatine kinase plus phosphocreatine/creatine pair), cytosolic proton production/consumption system (proton production/consumption by the creatine kinase-catalysed reaction, efflux/influx of protons), physiological size of the adenine nucleotide pool and some additional minor changes. Theoretical studies performed by means of the extended model demonstrated that the CK system, which allows for large changes in P(i) in relation to isolated mitochondria system, has no significant influence on the kinetic properties of oxidative phosphorylation, as inorganic phosphate only slightly modifies the relationship between the respiration rate and [ADP]. Computer simulations also suggested that the second-order dependence of oxidative phosphorylation on [ADP] proposed in the literature refers only to the ATP synthesis flux, but not to the oxygen consumption flux (the difference between these two fluxes being due to the proton leak). Next, time courses of changes in fluxes and metabolite concentrations during transition between different steady-states were simulated. The model suggests, in accordance with previous theoretical predictions, that activation of oxidative phosphorylation by an increase in [ADP] can (roughly) explain the behaviour of the system only at low work intensities, while at higher work intensities parallel activation of different steps of oxidative phosphorylation is involved.},

abstract = {System identification is a growing approach to sensory neurophysiology that facilitates the development of quantitative functional models of sensory processing. This approach provides a clear set of guidelines for combining experimental data with other knowledge about sensory function to obtain a description that optimally predicts the way that neurons process sensory information. This prediction paradigm provides an objective method for evaluating and comparing computational models. In this chapter we review many of the system identification algorithms that have been used in sensory neurophysiology, and we show how they can be viewed as variants of a single statistical inference problem. We then review many of the practical issues that arise when applying these methods to neurophysiological experiments: stimulus selection, behavioral control, model visualization, and validation. Finally we discuss several problems to which system identification has been applied recently, including one important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience: developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.},

abstract = {1. Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) is a form of synaptic plasticity which involves a retrograde messenger. We have performed experiments in Purkinje cells of rat cerebellar slices to determine the nature of this messenger. 2. DSI is mimicked by 2-(2,3-dicarboxycyclopropyl)-glycine (DCG-IV), a specific agonist of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). 3. DSI is reduced if transmitter release is inhibited by saturating doses of DCG-IV. 4. Both DSI and DCG-IV-induced inhibition are inhibited by L-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (L-AP3), a drug which interferes with several subtypes of mGluRs. 5. DSI is reduced if synaptic activity is enhanced by application of forskolin. 6. We propose that glutamate or a glutamate-like substance is the retrograde messenger implicated in DSI, and that the inhibition resulting from presynaptic glutamate binding is mediated by a decrease in the presynaptic concentration of cAMP.},

abstract = {Recent studies have emphasized the role of signals that travel from a target cell, in a retrograde direction, to cells that synapse on the target and influence their output. While the focus of most research on this topic has been on long-lasting alterations at excitatory synapses, evidence that implicates retrograde transmission in the transient reduction of GABAA-receptor-mediated inhibition in hippocampus and cerebellum has begun to accumulate. Brief depolarizations of the postsynaptic principal cells lead to increases in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, and a reduction in GABAA-receptor-mediated responses for 1-2 min. No concomitant reduction in postsynaptic GABAA-receptor responsiveness has been detected. Rather, release of GABA from inhibitory-interneuron terminals appears to be reduced. The properties of this 'depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition' might be appropriate for unique physiological roles.},

abstract = {The optimization of k-space sampling for nonlinear sparse MRI reconstruction is phrased as a Bayesian experimental design problem. Bayesian inference is approximated by a novel relaxation to standard signal processing primitives, resulting in an efficient optimization algorithm for Cartesian and spiral trajectories. On clinical resolution brain image data from a Siemens 3T scanner, automatically optimized trajectories lead to significantly improved images, compared to standard low-pass, equispaced, or variable density randomized designs. Insights into the nonlinear design optimization problem for MRI are given.},

abstract = {Efficient and dependable methods for detection and measurement of synaptic events are important for studies of synaptic physiology and neuronal circuit connectivity. As the published methods with detection algorithms based upon amplitude thresholding and fixed or scaled template comparisons are of limited utility for detection of signals with variable amplitudes and superimposed events that have complex waveforms, previous techniques are not applicable for detection of evoked synaptic events in photostimulation and other similar experimental situations. Here we report on a novel technique that combines the design of a bank of approximate matched filters with the detection and estimation theory to automatically detect and extract photostimluation-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from individually recorded neurons in cortical circuit mapping experiments. The sensitivity and specificity of the method were evaluated on both simulated and experimental data, with its performance comparable to that of visual event detection performed by human operators. This new technique was applied to quantify and compare the EPSCs obtained from excitatory pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons. In addition, our technique has been further applied to the detection and analysis of inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) responses. Given the general purpose of our matched filtering and signal recognition algorithms, we expect that our technique can be appropriately modified and applied to detect and extract other types of electrophysiological and optical imaging signals.},

abstract = {Evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) generated from a single GABAergic bouton were recorded and the functional properties were investigated. Native single boutons attached to mechanically dissociated rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, namely "synaptic bouton" preparation, were visualized with FM 1-43 dye and selectively stimulated by a glass pipette directed to a single bouton by focal stimulation. The GABAergic eIPSCs were elicited in like all-or-none fashion regarding both stimulus strength and pipette location, thus indicating that the eIPSCs result from the activation of a single bouton. The GABA release from the boutons was action potential dependent since eIPSCs were blocked in the presence of either voltage-dependent Na(+) or Ca(2+)channel blocker. Even in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), eIPSCs could be elicited by additional application of a voltage-dependent K(+) channel blocker, 4-AP. The GABA release depended on external Ca(2+) concentration. Amplitude histogram of eIPSCs did not follow Poisson distribution or show discrete peaks. As a result, this new experimental approach using both focal stimulation and a synaptic bouton preparation allows for a detailed study of the native synaptic machinery in nerve terminals measuring smaller than 1 microm in size in the CNS.},

abstract = {Neocortical GABA-containing interneurons form complex functional networks responsible for feedforward and feedback inhibition and for the generation of cortical oscillations associated with several behavioural functions. We previously reported that fast-spiking (FS), but not low-threshold-spiking (LTS), neocortical interneurons from rats generate a fast and precise self-inhibition mediated by inhibitory autaptic transmission. Here we show that LTS cells possess a different form of self-inhibition. LTS, but not FS, interneurons undergo a prominent hyperpolarization mediated by an increased K+-channel conductance. This self-induced inhibition lasts for many minutes, is dependent on an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] and is blocked by the cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251, indicating that it is mediated by the autocrine release of endogenous cannabinoids. Endocannabinoid-mediated slow self-inhibition represents a powerful and long-lasting mechanism that alters the intrinsic excitability of LTS neurons, which selectively target the major site of excitatory connections onto pyramidal neurons; that is, their dendrites. Thus, modulation of LTS networks after their sustained firing will lead to long-lasting changes of glutamate-mediated synaptic strength in pyramidal neurons, with consequences during normal and pathophysiological cortical network activities.},

In the cells of the central nervous system, maintenance of cell osmolarity and, hence, volume, is particularly crucial because of the restrictive nature of the skull. Cell volume regulation involves a variety of pathways, with considerable differences between cell types. One common pathway activated during hypo-osmotic stress involves chloride (Cl-) channels. However, hypo-osmotically stimulated anion permeability can be regulated by a diverse array of second messengers. Although neuronal swelling can occur in a number of pathological and nonpathological conditions, our understanding of neuronal volume regulation is limited. This article summarizes our current understanding of the role of anion channels during neuronal volume regulation.},

abstract = {1. Single-channel currents were recorded from Xenopus spinal neurons developing in vitro using the patch-clamp technique, to identify the channels underlying the large and small macroscopic Ca(2+)-activated Cl- currents (ICl(Ca)) present in these cells. 2. Channels of large (maxi-channels; 310 pS) and smaller conductance (mini-channels; 50-60 pS) are activated by elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Channel activity is not altered by subsequent removal of Ca2+ from the bath, arguing against a direct ligand-type Ca2+ dependence. The much higher incidence of channel activation in cell-attached patches from cells permeabilized with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 than in excised patches also suggests the involvement of some unidentified intracellular factor. 3. The reversal potential of maxi-Cl- channels is not altered by changes in Na+ concentration, but is shifted in the negative direction by the substitution of Cl- by methanesulfonate on the intracellular side of the patch, indicating their anionic selectivity. 4. Maxi-Cl- channels exhibited the presence of multiple probable subconductance states and showed marked voltage-dependent inactivation above and below +/- 20 mV. 5. Examination of maxi-Cl- channels at early times in culture (6-9 h) and 24 h later did not reveal any developmental change in the characteristics described above. However, the mean open duration of the channel was found to increase twofold during this period of time. 6. The simultaneous presence of maxi- and mini-Cl- channels prevented detailed characterization of the latter. The anionic selectivity of mini-Cl- channels is suggested by their reversal potential that lies close to the Cl- equilibrium potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {Wavelet analysis is presented as a new tool for analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs). The wavelet transform expands ERPs into a time-scale representation, which allows the analyst to zoom in on the small scale, fine structure details of an ERP or zoom out to examine the large scale, global waveshape. The time-scale representation is closely related to the more familiar time-frequency representation used in spectrograms of time-varying signals. However, time-scale representations have special properties that make them attractive for many ERP applications. In particular, time-scale representations permit theoretically unlimited time resolution for the detection of short-lived peaks and permit a flexible choice of wavelet basis functions for analyzing different types of ERPs. Generally, time-scale representations offer a formal basis for designing new, specialized filters for various ERP applications. Among recently explored applications of wavelet analysis to ERPs are (a) the precise identification of the time of occurrence of overlapping peaks in the auditory brainstem evoked response; (b) the extraction of single-trial ERPs from background EEG noise; (c) the decomposition of averaged ERP waveforms into orthogonal detail functions that isolate the waveform's experimental behavior in distinct, orthogonal frequency bands; and (d) the use of wavelet transform coefficients to concisely extract important information from ERPs that predicts human signal detection performance. In this tutorial we present an intuitive introduction to wavelets and the wavelet transform, concentrating on the multiresolution approach to wavelet analysis of ERP data. We then illustrate this approach with real data. Finally, we offer some speculations on future applications of wavelet analysis to ERP data.},

abstract = {The kinetic reactions of a voltage-dependent K+ channel, which constituted about 14% of all the recorded K+ channels in the membrane of cultured rat astrocytes were studied in detail. A scheme of one open and three closed states is necessary to describe the kinetic reactions of this channel. The channel contributes little to the resting membrane potential. Its steady state open probability (Po) is 0.06 at {\textminus}70 mV. When the cell is depolarized to 0 mV, Po approaches 1. This represents a 17-fold increase. Such channels could contribute to the potassium clearance by enhancing the effect of "spatial buffering." Additionally, single anion-selective channels with very high conductances were found in inside-out patches in approximately 15% of all recorded channels in the membrane of rat astrocytes. Channel openings are characterized by more than one conductance level; the main level showed a mean conductance of 400 pS. These channels are divided into two groups. Approximately 90% of the recorded chloride channels showed a strong voltage dependency of their current fluctuations. Within a relatively small potential range ({\textpm}15 mV) the channels have a high probability of being in the active state. After a voltage jump to varying testing potentials in the range of {\textpm}20 to {\textpm}50 mV the channels continued to be in the active state for some time and then closed to a shut state. If the testing potential persisted, the channels were not able to leave this shut state. The active state could only be reached again if the membrane potential was reset close to zero for some time. The time course of the current relaxation was measured by ensemble averaging of single channel current fluctuations. When at the end of a testing potential the voltage was set back to zero, the channel remained in the shut state for some time before it reached the open state again. The voltage dependence of this recovery period was analyzed as well but is not shown in this paper. The reaction indicates a nonstationary process as the open probability is time dependent, and for better differentiation I will call these channels nonstationary chloride channels. A subgroup of 10% of all recorded chloride channels showed no voltage-dependent kinetic reactions. I will denote them as stationary chloride channels. Both types of Cl{\textminus} channels are mainly permeable to anions but showed a slight permeability to cations. An idea of the role of these channels at this state must be highly speculative. The possibilities include a cell to cell transfer of material or a regulation of the internal or external ion environment. In the latter case, they could provide an uptake mechanism for potassium ions in addition to the spatial buffer currents.},

abstract = {At the cerebellar synapses between parallel fibers (PFs) and Purkinje cells (PCs), long-term depression (LTD) of the excitatory synaptic current has been assumed to be independent of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation because PCs lack NMDA receptors. However, we now report that LTD is suppressed by NMDA receptor antagonists that act on presynaptic NMDA receptors of the PFs. This effect is still observed when the input is restricted to a single fiber. Therefore, LTD does not require the spatial integration of multiple inputs. In contrast, it involves a temporal integration, since reliable LTD induction requires the PFs to fire two action potentials in close succession. This implies that LTD will selectively depress the response to a burst of presynaptic action potentials.},

abstract = {Axons from Xenopus sciatic nerve were demyelinated by intraneural injection of lysolecithin rendering the entire internodal axolema accessible to a patch electrode. In this region, three types of anion selective pores were found and characterized at the single-channel level. These included outwardly rectifying, inwardly rectifying, and maxi Cl- channels. The outwardly rectifying Cl- channels (24 pS) are activated by depolarization with a weak voltage dependence of 42 mV per e-fold change in open probability. The inwardly rectifying Cl- channels (27 pS) are insensitive to voltage, but can be blocked by internal application of 100 microM SITS or DIDS. The I-V curves of rectifying channels are S-shaped and can be fitted by a kinetic model with a single free energy barrier. The rectification may be related to the location of this barrier. The maxi Cl- channel (335 pS) is often open at the resting potential, but is inactivated by a large depolarization. The rectification, voltage dependence, and inactivation of these channels may contribute to the regulation of axonal Cl- balance and resting potential.},

The pattern of control was completely different under different conditions. For normoxic concentration, the main controlling steps in state 4, state 3.5 and state 3 were proton leak, ATP usage (hexokinase) and complex III, respectively. The pattern of control in state 4 was not changed at hypoxic oxygen concentration, while in state 3.5 and state 3 much of the control was shifted from other steps to cytochrome oxidase. The implications of the theoretical results obtained for the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in intact muscle are discussed.},

The defined medium consists of bovine serum albumin, insulin, transferrin, selenium, thyroxine, and the protease inhibitor aprotinin. About 95% of all cells were identified as neurons using tetanus toxin as a marker in an immunocytochemical assay. They survive for more than 4 weeks, showing a tendency to grow in cell clusters with a dense network of processes. The remaining cells (approximately 5%) were identified as astrocytes by their expression of vimentin and GFA protein and the lack of expression of fibronectin.},

abstract = {Rat hippocampal neurons, grown in dissociated culture for about 18 days, were exposed for 6 h to three days to stimuli which cause either an increase (GABAA antagonists, bicuculline or picrotoxin), or decrease (tetrodotoxin) in spontaneous neuronal activity. Individual neurons were stained with 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate and visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope. GABA antagonists caused a marked, up to 60%, increase in spine density on secondary dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons. This was associated with a small decrease in spine length. The rise in spine density was partially prevented by treatment with the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetra-acetate, or by blockade of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. Tetrodotoxin caused a marked elongation of dendritic spines (but did not cause a decrease in spine density comparable to the increase caused by picrotoxin). This effect was seen primarily but not exclusively in spines with no distinct head. Both treatments were most effective within 24 h of exposure. There were no other systematic effects of the drugs on the morphology of the dendritic spines. These results indicate that dendritic spines in cultured neurons depend on ongoing synaptic activity to maintain their shape, and that neurons respond to an increase in synaptic demand by an increase in spine density. Thus, dendritic spines are likely to have a role in short-term synaptic interaction rather than to constitute a long-term memory storage device.},

abstract = {OBJECT:Poor outcome is common after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Clinical studies suggest that cerebral hypoxia after traumatic brain injury is associated with poor outcome. In this study we examined the relationship between brain oxygen tension (PbtO(2)) and death after aneurysmal SAH.

METHODS:Forty-six patients, including 34 women and 12 men (Glasgow Coma Scale Score < or = 8 and median age 58.5 years) who underwent PbtO(2) monitoring were studied prospectively during a 2-year period in a neurosurgical intensive care unit at a University Level I Trauma Center. Brain oxygen tension, intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and brain temperature were continuously monitored, and treatment was directed toward ICP, CPP, and PbtO(2) targets. The relationship between PbtO(2) and 1-month survival was examined.

RESULTS:Data were available from 5424 hours of PbtO(2) monitoring. For the entire cohort the mean ICP, CPP, and PbtO(2) were 13.85 +/- 2.40, 84.05 +/- 3.41, and 30.79 +/- 1.91 mm Hg, respectively. Twenty-five patients died (54%). The mean daily PbtO(2) was higher in survivors than nonsurvivors (33.94 +/- 2.74 vs 28.14 +/- 2.59 mm Hg; p = 0.05). In addition, survivors had significantly shorter episodes of compromised PbtO(2) (defined as 15-25 mm Hg) than nonsurvivors (125.85 +/- 15.44 vs 271.14 +/- 55.23 minutes; p < 0.01). Intracranial pressure was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors. In contrast, the average CPP was significantly lower in nonsurvivors than survivors (76.96 +/- 5.50 vs 92.49 +/- 2.75 mm Hg; p = 0.01). When PbtO(2) was stratified according to CPP level, survivors had higher PbtO(2) levels. Following logistic regression, the number of episodes of compromised PbtO(2) (odds ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 1.003-1.2) and number of episodes of cerebral hypoxia (< 15 mm Hg; odds ratio 1.3, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.7) were more frequent in those who died.

CONCLUSIONS:Patient deaths after SAH may be associated with a lower mean PbtO(2) and longer periods of compromised cerebral oxygenation than in survivors. This knowledge may be used to help direct therapy.},

abstract = {Aldosterone, the most important sodium-retaining hormone, was first characterized >50 years ago. However, despite numerous studies including the classical work of Isidore S. "Izzy" Edelman showing that aldosterone action depended on ATP production, the mechanism by which it activates sodium reabsorption via the epithelial sodium channel remains unclear. Here, we report experiments that suggest that one of the key steps in aldosterone action is via an autocrine/paracrine system. The hormone stimulates ATP release from the basolateral side of the target kidney cell. Prevention of ATP accumulation or its removal blocks aldosterone action. ATP then acts via a purinergic mechanism to produce contraction of small groups of adjacent epithelial cells. Patch clamping demonstrates that it is these contracted cells that have channel activity. With progressive recruitment of contracting cells, there is then a parallel increase in transepithelial electrical conductance. In common with other stimuli of sodium transport, this pathway involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase blocks both cell contraction and conductance. We put forward the hypothesis that redistribution of the cell volume caused by the lateral contraction results in apical swelling and that this change, in turn, disrupts the epithelial sodium channel interaction with the F-actin cytoskeleton, opening the channel and hence increasing sodium transport.},

abstract = {In this study, we applied for the first time a multivariate analysis to describe the anatomy of cerebellar molecular layer interneurons. Forty variables extending over a variety of morphological features (geometrical, topological, and metrical) were obtained from a three-dimensional reconstruction of 26 rat rapid Golgi-stained neurons. The subsequent principal component analysis showed that the first principal component was strongly correlated with variables related to the depth of each cell's soma in the molecular layer. The second principal component was strongly correlated with parameters describing axonal morphology. Finally, an analysis of the distribution of these anatomical features suggested that these cells cannot be classified into distinct groups but, instead, represent one continuously varying population. Thus, the classical division of molecular layer neurons into deep basket cells and superficial stellate cells is not supported by our analysis. These results have important implications for the development of the cerebellar cortex as well as for the expected patterns of Purkinje cell activity following activation of the granule cell layer.},

abstract = {The study of the properties of DNA under high electric fields is of both fundamental and practical interest. We have exploited the high electric fields produced locally in the tip of a nanopipette to probe the motion of double- and single-stranded 40-mer DNA, a 1-kb single-stranded DNA, and a single-nucleotide triphosphate (dCTP) just inside and outside the pipette tip at different frequencies and amplitudes of applied voltages. We used dual laser excitation and dual color detection to simultaneously follow two fluorophore-labeled DNA sequences with millisecond time resolution, significantly faster than studies to date. A strong trapping effect was observed during the negative half cycle for all DNA samples and also the dCTP. This effect was maximum below 1 Hz and decreased with higher frequency. We assign this trapping to strong dielectrophoresis due to the high electric field and electric field gradient in the pipette tip. Dielectrophoresis in electrodeless tapered nanostructures has potential applications for controlled mixing and manipulation of short lengths of DNA and other biomolecules, opening new possibilities in miniaturized biological analysis.},

abstract = {In the present work a mathematical model of the cerebrovascular regulatory system in the rat is presented. The model, a generalization of our previous one, includes the reactivity of proximal segments of the cerebrovascular bed and the neurogenic and myogenic feedback regulatory mechanisms besides the action of chemical regulatory factors. The model is then used to analyze the interaction of mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow in several conditions of physiological importance. In the first stage of the work we simulated experiments in which the neural fibers are cut and artificially stimulated with external means. According to experimental evidence, simulation results point out the existence of an escape of blood flow from stimulation. The model imputes this escape phenomenon to the antagonistic action of chemical factors working on the distal segments of the cerebrovascular bed. In a second stage, we studied the neurogenic mechanism action in a physiological closed-loop condition. With this general model, autoregulation to arterial pressure changes and postischemic reactive hyperemia have been analyzed. A comparison of simulation results with recent experimental data shows that the model is able to produce 60-70% of the experimental regulatory capacity of the cerebrovascular bed. However, some relevant discrepancies still exist between the model and the experimental results, especially as regards the dilatory capacity of small cerebral arterioles. These discrepancies underline the existence of further regulatory mechanisms working on the cerebrovascular bed, the nature of which must still be clarified.},

abstract = {Changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic rates (CMRO2) have been used as indices for changes in neuronal activity. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can also measure cerebral haemodynamics and metabolic changes, enabling the possible use of multichannel recording of NIRS for functional optical imaging of human brain activity. Spatio-temporal variations of brain regions were demonstrated during various mental tasks. Non-synchronous behaviour of cerebral haemodynamics during the neuronal activation was observed. Gender- and handedness-dependent lateralization of the function between right and left hemispheres was demonstrated by simultaneous measurement using two NIR instruments during the mirror-drawing task. A lack of interhemispheric integration was observed with schizophrenic patients. These observations suggest an application for NIRS in psychiatric disease management, as an addition to clinical monitoring at the bedside. A time resolved 64-channel optical imaging system was constructed. This consisted of three picosecond laser diodes and 64 channels of TAC and CFD systems. Image reconstruction for phantom model systems was performed. Time-resolved quantitative optical imaging will become real in the very near future.},

abstract = {The membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin was imaged in buffer solution at room temperature with the atomic force microscope. Three different substrates were used: mica, silanized glass and lipid bilayers. Single bacteriorhodopsin molecules could be imaged in purple membranes adsorbed to mica. A depression was observed between the bacteriorhodopsin molecules. The two dimensional Fourier transform showed the hexagonal lattice with a lattice constant of 6.21 +/- 0.20 nm which is in agreement with results of electron diffraction experiments. Spots at a resolution of approximately 1.1 nm could be resolved. A protein, cationic ferritin, could be imaged bound to the purple membranes on glass which was silanized with aminopropyltriethoxysilane. This opens the possibility of studying receptor/ligand binding under native conditions. In addition, purple membranes bound to a lipid bilayer were imaged. These images may help in interpreting results of functional studies done with purple membranes adsorbed to black lipid membranes.},

abstract = {Membranes flex with changes in transmembrane potential as a result of changes in interfacial tension, the Lippman effect. We studied the membrane electromotility of Shaker K(+)-transfected HEK-293 cells in real time by using combined patch-clamp atomic force microscopy. In the voltage range where the channels were closed, Shaker expression had little effect on electromotility relative to wild-type cells. Depolarization between -120 and -40 mV resulted in a linear upward cantilever deflection equivalent to an increase in membrane tension. However, when depolarized sufficiently for channel opening, the electromotility saturated and only recovered over 10 s of milliseconds. This remarkable loss of motility was associated with channel opening, not ionic flux or movement of the voltage sensors. The IL mutant of Shaker, in which the voltage dependence of channel opening but not sensor movement is shifted to more positive potentials, caused the loss of electromotility saturation also to shift to more positive potentials. The temporary loss of electromotility associated with channel opening is probably caused by local buckling of the bilayer as the inner half of the channel expands as expected from X-ray structural data.},

For the past two decades, numerous studies have investigated long-term changes in synaptic efficacy at excitatory glutamatergic synapses. Although inhibitory synapses are essential for proper functioning of the neuronal network, attention has focused only recently on describing and characterizing plasticity at these types of synapse. Not surprisingly, different forms of plasticity at GABAergic, and the closely related glycinergic, synapses have been reported in several regions of the brain. Here we review these different forms of plasticity and focus on their possible roles in developing and adult neuronal networks.},

abstract = {A specific antiserum was used to ascertain the distribution of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) in the rat brain at the light and electron microscope levels. Light microscopy showed MAP2 to be present only in neurons, and only in the dendrites and the perikaryon of each cell. This same polarized distribution pattern was found in the Purkinje, Golgi, basket, stellate, and granule cells of the cerebellum, and also in neurons of the hippocampus, the olfactory bulb, and the midbrain. While labelling of the dendritic arborization was extensive and intense, MAP2 density tended to decrease in the proximal dendritic trunk. Particularly in large neurons (e.g., Purkinje, Golgi, and pyramidal cells), staining was reproducibly weaker in the cell body than in the main dendrites. Dendritic contours generally appeared smooth, without any evidence of staining of dendritic spines. An electron microscope examination of the cerebellum confirmed the presence of MAP2 reactivity in neurons and its absence from axons and non-neuronal cells. MAP2 in dendrites was associated with microtubules, while MAP2 in neuronal perikarya was associated with polyribosomes. There was no evidence of specific staining in dendritic spines and in postsynaptic densities. MAP2 is a novel dendritic marker and labels part of a specific dendritic cytoskeleton, different from that in axons and non-neuronal cells.},

abstract = {A computer model of oxidative phosphorylation was developed in isolated muscle mitochondria [Korzeniewski and Mazat: Biochem J 319: 143-148, 1996] and in intact skeletal muscle [Korzeniewski and Zoladz: Biophys Chem 92: 17-34, 2001]. Within this model the dependence on different metabolite concentrations of the rate of each enzymatic reaction, process and flux is described by an appropriate kinetic equation. The changes of metabolite concentrations over time are described by a set of ordinary differential equations. The model has been very extensively tested by a comparison of computer simulations with a broad set of experimental results concerning various kinetic properties of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Next the model was used for theoretical studies on the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation in intact muscle cells. The model decidedly supports the so-called parallel-activation mechanism or each-step-activation mechanism of adjusting the rate of ATP supply to the current energy demand [Korzeniewski: Biochem J 330: 1189-1195, 1998; Korzeniewski: Biochem J 375: 799-804, 2003]. Because of this mechanism, not only ATP usage, but also the substrate dehydrogenation system and all oxidative phosphorylation complexes (complex I, complex III, complex IV, ATP synthase, ATP/ADP carrier, phosphate carrier) are directly (and not by changes in metabolite concentrations) activated by some intracellular factor(s) related to muscle contraction, probably by calcium ions, during the transition from rest to work. This mechanism is able to account for several kinetic properties of oxidative phosphorylation that cannot be explained by other mechanisms postulated in the literature. Thus the discussed kinetic model of oxidative phosphorylation has appeared to be a very useful research tool.},

abstract = {A number of important data analysis problems in neuroscience can be solved using state-space models. In this article, we describe fast methods for computing the exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) path of the hidden state variable in these models, given spike train observations. If the state transition density is log-concave and the observation model satisfies certain standard assumptions, then the optimization problem is strictly concave and can be solved rapidly with Newton-Raphson methods, because the Hessian of the loglikelihood is block tridiagonal. We can further exploit this block-tridiagonal structure to develop efficient parameter estimation methods for these models. We describe applications of this approach to neural decoding problems, with a focus on the classic integrate-and-fire model as a key example.},

abstract = {Pinched-off presynaptic nerve terminals (synaptosomes) possess significant regulatory volume increase (RVI) and regulatory volume decrease (RVD) capabilities. Following a swelling induced by a hypotonic challenge, the synaptosomes regulate their volume and adjust it, in 2 min, to within 5% of its initial value (RVD) at an initial rate of -0.77 +/- 0.10%/s (mean +/- SEM). Following a shrinking induced by a hypertonic challenge, the synaptosomes also regulate their volume at an initial rate of 0.18 +/- 0.02%/s (RVI), resulting in a new steady state, reached within 5-10 min, with a synaptosomal volume below the original volume. The omission of Na+ or K+ ions from the extrasynaptosomal medium reduces the initial rate of RVI by 72.5 and 66.5%, respectively. The "loop diuretics" bumetanide and furosemide significantly inhibited the RVI of the synaptosomes. In contrast, ouabain, amiloride, or 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid did not have any significant effect on RVI parameters. Furthermore, bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb uptake by rat brain synaptosomes was stimulated threefold by a hypertonic perturbation of 30%. Thus we conclude that the RVI of synaptosomes is mainly due to a stimulation of the Na+, K+, Cl- co-transport system induced by the synaptosomal shrinking following the hypertonic challenge.},

They have a homologous S1-S6 region, but are unique at the N and C termini. At the C terminus, MaxiK channels have four additional hydrophobic regions (S7-S10) of unknown topology. At the N terminus, we have recently proposed a new model where MaxiK channels have an additional transmembrane region (S0) that confers beta subunit regulation. Using transient expression of epitope tagged MaxiK channels, in vitro translation, functional, and "in vivo" reconstitution assays, we now show that MaxiK channels have seven transmembrane segments (S0-S6) at the N terminus and a S1-S6 region that folds in a similar way as in voltage-gated ion channels. Further, our results indicate that hydrophobic segments S9-S10 in the C terminus are cytoplasmic and unequivocally demonstrate that S0 forms an additional transmembrane segment leading to an exoplasmic N terminus.},

abstract = {We have incorporated membrane mirror technology over a discrete array of pixel wells to create both high-efficiency optical shutters and spatial light modulators (SLM). A continuous metalized-membrane mirror with greater than 98% reflectivity minimizes optical insertion loss. This mirror is electrostatically deformed into the wells with either a common electrode (shutter) or pixilated electrodes (SLM). By using a spatial filter, analog intensity optical modulation is realized. Both 1-D (linear) and 2-D grating pixel patterns have been investigated. With the appropriate pixel dimensions, both coherent monochromatic and broadband incoherent light within the 0.25 to 10.6 micron range can be modulated with contrast ratios up to 1000:1. Small well sizes (approximately 10-micron diameter) allow for modulation speeds up to 1 MHz. The theoretical foundations for the well layout, the membrane mirror deformation and its diffraction properties, and the design trade-offs are detailed. We have applied our membrane mirror technology to CMOS VLSI circuits creating a high-speed, high-efficiency spatial light modulator capable of 80 X 64 resolution and scalable to HDTV standards. The membrane mirror SLM provides either amplitude or phase modulation. In the phase modulation mode, at least two waves of stroke per discrete well are possible. },

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The dynamics of gene regulation play a crucial role in a cellular control: allowing the cell to express the right proteins to meet changing needs. Some needs, such as correctly anticipating the day-night cycle, require complicated oscillatory features. In the analysis of gene regulatory networks, mathematical models are frequently used to understand how a network's structure enables it to respond appropriately to external inputs. These models typically consist of a set of ordinary differential equations, describing a network of biochemical reactions, and unknown kinetic parameters, chosen such that the model best captures experimental data. However, since a model's parameter values are uncertain, and since dynamic responses to inputs are highly parameter-dependent, it is difficult to assess the confidence associated with these in silico predictions. In particular, models with complex dynamics - such as oscillations - must be fit with computationally expensive global optimization routines, and cannot take advantage of existing measures of identifiability. Despite their difficulty to model mathematically, limit cycle oscillations play a key role in many biological processes, including cell cycling, metabolism, neuron firing, and circadian rhythms.

RESULTS:In this study, we employ an efficient parameter estimation technique to enable a bootstrap uncertainty analysis for limit cycle models. Since the primary role of systems biology models is the insight they provide on responses to rate perturbations, we extend our uncertainty analysis to include first order sensitivity coefficients. Using a literature model of circadian rhythms, we show how predictive precision is degraded with decreasing sample points and increasing relative error. Additionally, we show how this method can be used for model discrimination by comparing the output identifiability of two candidate model structures to published literature data.

CONCLUSIONS:Our method permits modellers of oscillatory systems to confidently show that a model's dynamic characteristics follow directly from experimental data and model structure, relaxing assumptions on the particular parameters chosen. Ultimately, this work highlights the importance of continued collection of high-resolution data on gene and protein activity levels, as they allow the development of predictive mathematical models.},

abstract = {Nonlinear time series analysis is becoming a more and more reliable tool for the study of complicated dynamics from measurements. The concept of low-dimensional chaos has proven to be fruitful in the understanding of many complex phenomena despite the fact that very few natural systems have actually been found to be low dimensional deterministic in the sense of the theory. In order to evaluate the long term usefulness of the nonlinear time series approach as inspired by chaos theory, it will be important that the corresponding methods become more widely accessible. This paper, while not a proper review on nonlinear time series analysis, tries to make a contribution to this process by describing the actual implementation of the algorithms, and their proper usage. Most of the methods require the choice of certain parameters for each specific time series application. We will try to give guidance in this respect. The scope and selection of topics in this article, as well as the implementational choices that have been made, correspond to the contents of the software package TISEAN which is publicly available from http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/{\textasciitilde}tisean . In fact, this paper can be seen as an extended manual for the TISEAN programs. It fills the gap between the technical documentation and the existing literature, providing the necessary entry points for a more thorough study of the theoretical background.

abstract = {Consider an underdetermined system of linear equations y = Ax with known y and d x n matrix A. We seek the nonnegative x with the fewest nonzeros satisfying y = Ax. In general, this problem is NP-hard. However, for many matrices A there is a threshold phenomenon: if the sparsest solution is sufficiently sparse, it can be found by linear programming. We explain this by the theory of convex polytopes. Let a(j) denote the jth column of A, 1 < or = j < or = n, let a0 = 0 and P denote the convex hull of the a(j). We say the polytope P is outwardly k-neighborly if every subset of k vertices not including 0 spans a face of P. We show that outward k-neighborliness is equivalent to the statement that, whenever y = Ax has a nonnegative solution with at most k nonzeros, it is the nonnegative solution to y = Ax having minimal sum. We also consider weak neighborliness, where the overwhelming majority of k-sets of a(j)s not containing 0 span a face of P. This implies that most nonnegative vectors x with k nonzeros are uniquely recoverable from y = Ax by linear programming. Numerous corollaries follow by invoking neighborliness results. For example, for most large n by 2n underdetermined systems having a solution with fewer nonzeros than roughly half the number of equations, the sparsest solution can be found by linear programming.},

abstract = {Scanning ion conductance microscopy has been applied to neuronal growth cones of the leech either to image or to stimulate them. Growth cone advance was recorded in non-contact mode using a 2% ion current decrease criterion for pipette-membrane distance control. We demonstrate effective growth cone remodelling using a 5% criterion (near-scanning). Recurrent line near-scanning aligned growth cone processes along the scan line. The new membrane protrusions, marked by DiI, started a few minutes after scanning onset and progressively grew in thickness. Using scanning patterns suitable for connecting distinct growth cones, new links were consistently developed. Although the underlying mechanism is still a matter for investigation, a mechanical perturbation produced by the moving probe appeared to induce the process formation. Thanks to its deterministic and interactive features, this novel approach to guiding growth cones is a promising way to develop networks of identified neurons as well as link them with artificial structures.},

abstract = {The HEK cell line has been extensively used as an expression tool for recombinant proteins since it was generated over 25 years ago. Although of epithelial origin, its biochemical machinery is capable of carrying out most of the post-translational folding and processing required to generate functional, mature protein from a wide spectrum of both mammalian and non-mammalian nucleic acids. Though popular as a transient expression system, this cell type has also seen wide use in stably transfected forms (i.e. transformed cells) to study a variety of cell-biological questions in neurobiology. The principal attributes which have made the HEK cell a popular choice among electrophysiologists to study isolated receptor channels include; its quick and easy reproduction and maintenance; amenability to transfection using a wide variety of methods; high efficiency of transfection and protein production; faithful translation and processing of proteins; and small cell size with minimal processes appropriate for voltage-clamp experimentation. These, and other attributes, also mean that complementary biochemical/cell biological evaluations of expressed proteins can be performed in concert with functional analyses to establish detailed pharmacological and biophysical profiles for the action of new drugs and their targets. The increased amount of sequence information available from the human genome has placed greater emphasis upon heterologous cell expression systems as targets for high throughput structure-function evaluation of novel drug targets and disease markers. Here we have highlighted some of the innate characteristics of the HEK cell in order that its suitability as a vehicle for the expression of a gene product can be assessed for particular needs. We have also detailed some of the standard methods used for transfection and obtaining functional data from electrophysiological recording techniques.},

abstract = {Large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels belong to the S4 superfamily of K+ channels that include voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels characterized by having six (S1-S6) transmembrane domains and a positively charged S4 domain. As Kv channels, BK channels contain a S4 domain, but they have an extra (S0) transmembrane domain that leads to an external NH2-terminus. The BK channel is activated by internal Ca2+, and using chimeric channels and mutagenesis, three distinct Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanisms with different divalent cation selectivity have been identified in its large COOH-terminus. Two of these putative Ca2+-binding domains activate the BK channel when cytoplasmic Ca2+ reaches micromolar concentrations, and a low Ca2+ affinity mechanism may be involved in the physiological regulation by Mg2+. The presence in the BK channel of multiple Ca2+-binding sites explains the huge Ca2+ concentration range (0.1 microM-100 microM) in which the divalent cation influences channel gating. BK channels are also voltage-dependent, and all the experimental evidence points toward the S4 domain as the domain in charge of sensing the voltage. Calcium can open BK channels when all the voltage sensors are in their resting configuration, and voltage is able to activate channels in the complete absence of Ca2+. Therefore, Ca2+ and voltage act independently to enhance channel opening, and this behavior can be explained using a two-tiered allosteric gating mechanism.},

The mini frequency potentiation is initiated postsynaptically and requires activity of NMDA receptors. Although the frequency of unitary quantal responses increases strongly, their amplitude remains little changed with potentiation. Tests of postsynaptic responsiveness rule out recruitment of latent glutamate receptor clusters. Thus, postsynaptic induction can lead to enhancement of presynaptic transmitter release. The sustained potentiation of mini frequency is expressed even in the absence of Ca2+ entry into presynaptic terminals.},

abstract = {We have developed a method for simultaneous recording of high-resolution topography and cell surface fluorescence in a single scan which we call scanning surface confocal microscopy. The resolution of the system allows imaging of individual fluorescent particles in the nanometer range on fixed or live cells. We used this technique to record the interaction of single virus-like particles with the cell surface and demonstrated that single particles sink into the membrane in invaginations reminiscent of caveolae or pinocytic vesicles. This method provides a technique for elucidating the interaction of individual viruses and other nanoparticles, such as gene therapy vectors, with target cells. Furthermore, this technique should find widespread application for studying the relationship of fluorescently tagged molecules with components of the cell plasma membrane.},

abstract = {A specialized scanning ion conductance microscope (SICM) for imaging living cells has been developed from a conventional patch-clamp apparatus, which uses a glass micropipette as the sensitive probe. In contrast with other types of scanning probe microscope, the SICM probe has significant advantages for imaging living cells: it is most suitable for imaging samples immersed in water solutions; and since the probe senses ion current and does not need physical contact with the sample during the scan, any preliminary preparation of cells (fixation or adherence to a substrate) is unnecessary. We have successfully imaged murine melanocytes in growth medium. The microscope images the highly convoluted surface structures without damaging or deforming them, and reveals the true, three-dimensional relief of the cells. This instrument has considerable ability to operate, potentially simultaneously, in applications as diverse as real-time microscopy, electrophysiology, micromanipulation and drug delivery.},

abstract = {Inhibitory interneurons in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex play an essential role in cerebellar physiology by providing feed-forward inhibition to efferent Purkinje cells. Morphologic characteristics have been utilized to classify these cells as either basket cells or stellate cells. Conflicting evidence exists as to whether these cells are of distinct lineage and develop by employing discrete genetic programs, or whether their characteristic morphologic differences result from external cues that they encounter only after they have settled in their final territory in the molecular layer. We used primary dissociated cerebellar cultures established from early postnatal mice to study dendritogenesis of basket/stellate cells, identified by immunostaining for parvalbumin, under experimentally controlled conditions. We find that the radial axonal orientation of stem dendrites is non-random, suggesting a cell-intrinsic component defining this morphologic trait. In contrast, the expanse and complexity of basket/stellate cell dendrites is modulated by the granule cell derived neurotrophin, BDNF. BDNF-induced morphogenetic effects decline with ongoing development. Overall, our data do not provide evidence for a distinct lineage or genetic makeup of cerebellar molecular layer inhibitory interneurons.},

abstract = {Hidden Markov models have been used to restore recorded signals of single ion channels buried in background noise. Parameter estimation and signal restoration are usually carried out through likelihood maximization by using variants of the Baum-Welch forward-backward procedures. This paper presents an alternative approach for dealing with this inferential task. The inferences are made by using a combination of the framework provided by Bayesian statistics and numerical methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo stochastic simulation. The reliability of this approach is tested by using synthetic signals of known characteristics. The expectations of the model parameters estimated here are close to those calculated using the Baum-Welch algorithm, but the present methods also yield estimates of their errors. Comparisons of the results of the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach with those obtained by filtering and thresholding demonstrate clearly the superiority of the new methods.},

abstract = {The recently discovered epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)/degenerin (DEG) gene family encodes sodium channels involved in various cell functions in metazoans. Subfamilies found in invertebrates or mammals are functionally distinct. The degenerins in Caenorhabditis elegans participate in mechanotransduction in neuronal cells, FaNaC in snails is a ligand-gated channel activated by neuropeptides, and the Drosophila subfamily is expressed in gonads and neurons. In mammals, ENaC mediates Na+ transport in epithelia and is essential for sodium homeostasis. The ASIC genes encode proton-gated cation channels in both the central and peripheral nervous system that could be involved in pain transduction. This review summarizes the physiological roles of the different channels belonging to this family, their biophysical and pharmacological characteristics, and the emerging knowledge of their molecular structure. Although functionally different, the ENaC/DEG family members share functional domains that are involved in the control of channel activity and in the formation of the pore. The functional heterogeneity among the members of the ENaC/DEG channel family provides a unique opportunity to address the molecular basis of basic channel functions such as activation by ligands, mechanotransduction, ionic selectivity, or block by pharmacological ligands.},

abstract = {Before we apply nonlinear techniques, for example those inspired by chaos theory, to dynamical phenomena occurring in nature, it is necessary to first ask if the use of such advanced techniques is justified "by the data". While many processes in nature seem very unlikely a priori to be linear, the possible nonlinear nature might not be evident in specific aspects of their dynamics. The method of surrogate data has become a very popular tool to address such a question. However, while it was meant to provide a statistically rigorous, foolproof framework, some limitations and caveats have shown up in its practical use. In this paper, recent efforts to understand the caveats, avoid the pitfalls, and to overcome some of the limitations, are reviewed and augmented by new material. In particular, we will discuss specific as well as more general approaches to constrained randomisation, providing a full range of examples. New algorithms will be introduced for unevenly sampled and multivariate data and for surrogate spike trains. The main limitation, which lies in the interpretability of the test results, will be illustrated through instructive case studies. We will also discuss some implementational aspects of the realisation of these methods in the TISEAN (http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/{\textasciitilde}tisean) software package.

abstract = {1. Single-channel currents activated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonists were analysed in the presence of various extracellular concentrations of divalent cations in outside-out patches from mouse neurones in primary culture. 2. In nominally Mg2+-free solutions the opening and closing of the channels leads to rectangular current pulses, the mean duration of which varies little with membrane potential. After addition of Mg2+, the single-channel currents recorded at negative potentials appear in bursts of short openings separated by brief closures. 3. The duration of the short openings decreases with increasing Mg2+ concentration, while the duration of the short closures is independent of the Mg2+ concentration. Depolarization increases the duration of the short openings and decreases the duration of the short closures. 4. The dependence of the burst structure on the Mg2+ concentration and on membrane potential is compatible to a first approximation with a model in which Mg2+ ions enter the open channel and block it by binding at a deep site. A better approximation requires, however, additional assumptions such as Mg2+ permeation and/or interactions between Ca2+ and Mg2+. 5. Increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 1 to 100 mM produces three effects on the currents flowing through NMDA channels. It shifts the reversal potential towards a positive value (+30 mV); it reduces the outward current flowing through the NMDA channels at very positive potentials; it reduces the inward current flowing at negative potentials. 6. The interpretation of the effects of Ca2+ appears to require three hypotheses: that Ca2+ permeates the NMDA channel, that there exists a significant surface potential at the entrance of the NMDA channel in physiological solutions and that both Ca2+ and monovalent cations bind to the channel, binding being stronger in the case of Ca2+ ions. 7. While Co2+ and, to a lesser extent, Mn2+ mimic the effects of Mg2+ on the NMDA channel, Ca2+, Ba2+ and Cd2+ do not. The distinction between Mg2+-like and Ca2+-like divalent cations corresponds to a difference in the speed of exchange of the water molecules surrounding the cations in solutions. Thus, it is possible that permeation occurs for all the divalent cations, but is slower for those which are slowly dehydrated.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION:Mathematical description of biological reaction networks by differential equations leads to large models whose parameters are calibrated in order to optimally explain experimental data. Often only parts of the model can be observed directly. Given a model that sufficiently describes the measured data, it is important to infer how well model parameters are determined by the amount and quality of experimental data. This knowledge is essential for further investigation of model predictions. For this reason a major topic in modeling is identifiability analysis.

RESULTS:We suggest an approach that exploits the profile likelihood. It enables to detect structural non-identifiabilities, which manifest in functionally related model parameters. Furthermore, practical non-identifiabilities are detected, that might arise due to limited amount and quality of experimental data. Last but not least confidence intervals can be derived. The results are easy to interpret and can be used for experimental planning and for model reduction.

AVAILABILITY:An implementation is freely available for MATLAB and the PottersWheel modeling toolbox at http://web.me.com/andreas.raue/profile/software.html.

abstract = {Hidden Markov models have recently been used to model single ion channel currents as recorded with the patch clamp technique from cell membranes. The estimation of hidden Markov models parameters using the forward-backward and Baum-Welch algorithms can be performed at signal to noise ratios that are too low for conventional single channel kinetic analysis; however, the application of these algorithms relies on the assumptions that the background noise be white and that the underlying state transitions occur at discrete times. To address these issues, we present an "H-noise" algorithm that accounts for correlated background noise and the randomness of sampling relative to transitions. We also discuss three issues that arise in the practical application of the algorithm in analyzing single channel data. First, we describe a digital inverse filter that removes the effects of the analog antialiasing filter and yields a sharp frequency roll-off. This enhances the performance while reducing the computational intensity of the algorithm. Second, the data may be contaminated with baseline drifts or deterministic interferences such as 60-Hz pickup. We propose an extension of previous results to consider baseline drift. Finally, we describe the extension of the algorithm to multiple data sets.},

Subunit-specific antibodies reveal high levels of SK3 immunoreactivity in laminas I, II, and III of the spinal cord. Among dorsal root ganglion neurons, both peripherin-positive (C-type) and peripherin-negative (A-type) cells show intense SK3 immunoreactivity. Furthermore, dorsal root-stimulated sensory responses recorded in vitro are inhibited when SK channel activity is increased with 1-ethyl-2-benzimidazolinone (1-EBIO). In vivo electrophysiological recordings show that neuronal responses to naturally evoked nociceptive and nonnociceptive stimuli increase after application of the selective SK channel blocker 8,14-diaza-1,7(1,4)-diquinolinacyclotetradecaphanedium di-trifluoroacetate (UCL 1848), indicating that SK channels are normally active in moderating afferent input. Conversely, neuronal responses evoked by mechanical stimuli are inhibited when SK channel activity is increased with 1-EBIO. These effects are reversed by the subsequent application of UCL 1848. Our data demonstrate that SK channels have an important role in controlling sensory input into the spinal cord.},

abstract = {The medial superior olive (MSO) is part of the binaural auditory pathway, receiving excitatory projections from both cochlear nuclei and an inhibitory input from the ipsilateral medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). We characterised the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents of MSO neurones in 3- to 14-day-old rats using whole-cell patch-clamp methods in a brain slice preparation.A dual component EPSC was mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors. The AMPA receptor-mediated EPSC decayed with a time constant of 1.99+/-0.16 ms (n = 8). Following blockade of glutamate receptors, a monosynaptic strychnine-sensitive response was evoked on stimulation of the MNTB, indicative of a glycine receptor-mediated IPSC. GABAA receptors contributed to IPSCs in rats under 6 days old (bicuculline blocked 30% of the IPSC). In older rats little or no bicuculline-sensitive component was detectable, except in the presence of flunitrazepam. These glycinergic IPSCs showed a reversal potential that varied with changes in [Cl-]i, as predicted by the Nernst equation. The IPSC exhibited two developmentally relevant changes. (i) At around postnatal day 6, the GABAA receptor-mediated component declined, leaving a predominant glycine-mediated IPSC. The isolated glycinergic IPSC decayed with time constants of 7.8+/-0.3 and 38.3+/-1.7 ms, with the slower component contributing 7.8+/-0.6% of the peak amplitude (n = 121, 3-11 days old, -70 mV, 25 deg C). (ii) After day 11 the IPSC fast decay accelerated to 3.9+/-0.3 ms (n = 12) and the magnitude of the slow component declined to less than 1%. Spontaneous miniature glycinergic IPSCs (mIPSCs) were variable in amplitude and were of large conductance (1.83+/-0.19 nS, n = 8). The amplitude was unchanged on lowering [Ca2+]o. The time course of evoked and spontaneous miniature glycinergic IPSCs were compared. The 10-90% rise times were 0.7 and 0.6 ms, respectively. The evoked IPSC decayed with a fast time constant of 7.2+/-0.7 ms, while the mIPSC decayed with a fast time constant of 5.3+/-0.4 ms in the same seven cells.The glycinergic IPSC decay was voltage dependent with an e-fold change over 118 mV. The temperature dependence of the IPSC decay indicated a Q10 value of 2. Picrotoxin and cyanotriphenylborate had little or no effect on IPSCs from 6- to 14-day-old animals, implying homomeric channels are rare. We conclude that the MSO receives excitatory inputs mediated by AMPA and NMDA receptors and a strong glycinergic IPSC which has a significant contribution from GABAA receptors in neonatal rats. Functionally, the IPSC could increase membrane conductance during the decay of binaural glutamatergic EPSCs, thus refining coincidence detection and interaural timing differences.},

abstract = {The assumption that synaptic and extrasynaptic glutamate receptors are similar underpins many studies that have sought to relate the behavior of channels in excised patches to the macroscopic properties of the EPSC. We have examined this issue for NMDA receptors in cerebellar granule cells, the small size of which allows the opening of individual synaptic NMDA channels to be resolved directly. We have used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to determine the conductance and open time of NMDA channels activated during the EPSC and used cell-attached and outside-out recordings to examine NMDA receptors in somatic membrane. Conductance and open time of synaptic channels were indistinguishable from those of extrasynaptic channels in cell-attached patches. However, the channel conductance in outside-out patches was 20% lower than in cell-attached recordings. This change was partially reduced by dantrolene and phalloidin, suggesting that it may involve depolymerization of actin following Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Our results demonstrate that synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors have similar microscopic properties. However, NMDA channel conductance is reduced following the formation of an outside-out patch.},

abstract = {We have investigated the single-channel and whole-cell behaviour of recombinant N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors formed from NR1a and NR2D receptor subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The EC50 for apparent steady-state activation of NR1a/NR2D receptors by glutamate was 450 nM, while extracellular MG2+ produced a voltage-dependent block of glutamate responses with an IC50 of 440 microM at -70 mV. At negative holding potentials glutamate-activated NR1a/NR2D single-channel currents, in 0.85 mM external Ca2+, had slope conductances of 35 pS for the main level, and 17 pS for the sublevel; direct transitions occurred between these two conductance levels. On average 35 pS events had mean open times of 1.01 +/- 0.04 ms, whereas the mean open times of 17 pS events were consistently longer (1.28 +/- 0.06 ms). In 5 mM external Ca2+ the larger conductance level was reduced to 20 pS whereas in Ca(2+)-free solutions it was increased to 50 pS. The frequency of transitions between the main and subconductance levels showed temporal asymmetry: 35-17 pS transitions were more frequent (61%) than 17-35 pS transitions. This asymmetry was not affected by alterations in the external Ca2+ concentration (up to 5 mM). In conclusion, the NR1a/NR2D channel is, like NR1a/NR2C, a 'low conductance' NMDA channel, but it can be distinguished from NR1a/NR2C channels on the basis of transition asymmetry and differences in the open times of its main and sub-conductance levels.},

abstract = {This paper reports a series of 5 experiments concerned with a possible role for N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in certain types of learning. The results show that chronic intraventricular infusion of the NMDA receptor antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (D,L-AP5) caused an impairment of spatial but not of visual discrimination learning in rats. Such selectivity of the learning impairment occurred despite widespread distribution of the drug throughout the CNS. AP5 sometimes caused a disturbance of sensorimotor function during learning, but one experiment addressing whether this disturbance could be responsible for the spatial learning impairment established that it was statistically independent. Another experiment showed that AP5 did not affect the retention of previously acquired spatial information. These behavioral effects were all obtained with a concentration of AP5 that, in a final study, was found to be sufficient to block hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in vivo without affecting normal synaptic transmission. Taken together, these observations (1) implicate NMDA receptors in certain types of learning, and (2) extend recent work showing that saturation of LTP causes an anterograde spatial amnesia (McNaughton et al., 1986). A preliminary report of parts of this work has been published (Morris et al., 1986a).},

abstract = {Previous work has established that dendritic spines, sites of excitatory input in CNS neurons, can be highly dynamic, in later development as well as in mature brain. Although spine motility has been proposed to facilitate the formation of new synaptic contacts, we have reported that spines continue to be dynamic even if they bear synaptic contacts. An outstanding question related to this finding is whether the presynaptic terminals that contact dendritic spines are as dynamic as their postsynaptic targets. Using multiphoton time-lapse microscopy of GFP-labeled Purkinje cells and DiI-labeled granule cell parallel fiber afferents in cerebellar slices, we monitored the dynamic behavior of both presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic dendritic spines in the same preparation. We report that while spines are dynamic, the presynaptic terminals they contact are quite stable. We confirmed the relatively low levels of presynaptic terminal motility by imaging parallel fibers in vivo. Finally, spine motility can occur when a functional presynaptic terminal is apposed to it. These analyses further call into question the function of spine motility, and to what extent the synapse breaks or maintains its contact during the movement of the spine.},

abstract = {Tracking spectral changes of rapidly varying signals is a demanding task. In this study, we explore on Monte Carlo-simulated glutamate-activated AMPA patch and synaptic currents whether a wavelet analysis offers such a possibility. Unlike Fourier methods that determine only the frequency content of a signal, the wavelet analysis determines both the frequency and the time. This is owing to the nature of the basis functions, which are infinite for Fourier transforms (sines and cosines are infinite), but are finite for wavelet analysis (wavelets are localized waves). In agreement with previous reports, the frequency of the stationary patch current fluctuations is higher for larger currents, whereas the mean-variance plots are parabolic. The spectra of the current fluctuations and mean-variance plots are close to the theoretically predicted values. The median frequency of the synaptic and nonstationary patch currents is, however, time dependent, though at the peak of synaptic currents, the median frequency is insensitive to the number of glutamate molecules released. Such time dependence demonstrates that the "composite spectra" of the current fluctuations gathered over the whole duration of synaptic currents cannot be used to assess the mean open time or effective mean open time of AMPA channels. The current (patch or synaptic) versus median frequency plots show hysteresis. The median frequency is thus not a simple reflection of the overall receptor saturation levels and is greater during the rise phase for the same saturation level. The hysteresis is due to the higher occupancy of the doubly bound state during the rise phase and not due to the spatial spread of the saturation disk, which remains remarkably constant. Albeit time dependent, the variance of the synaptic and nonstationary patch currents can be accurately determined. Nevertheless the evaluation of the number of AMPA channels and their single current from the mean-variance plots of patch or synaptic currents is not highly accurate owing to the varying number of the activatable AMPA channels caused by desensitization. The spatial nonuniformity of open, bound, and desensitized AMPA channels, and the time dependence and spatial nonuniformity of the glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft, further reduce the accuracy of estimates of the number of AMPA channels from synaptic currents. In conclusion, wavelet analysis of nonstationary fluctuations of patch and synaptic currents expands our ability to determine accurately the variance and frequency of current fluctuations, demonstrates the limits of applicability of techniques currently used to evaluate the single channel current and number of AMPA channels, and offers new insights into the mechanisms involved in the generation of unitary quantal events at excitatory central synapses.},

By measuring amplitude and rhythm we can quantitate contraction of ESCM. This method gives, within the same experiment, an assessment of the number and position of ESCM within the layer of mixed cell types, as well as an accurate measure of the response of individual ESCM. Using different modulators of contraction as examples we showed how SICM could be used for recording their responses. We subsequently demonstrated that this model can be used to investigate the protective effect of antiarrhythmogenic drugs.},

abstract = {The period required for NMDA channels to open for the first time after agonist binding (the first latency) was estimated in outside-out patch recordings from rat hippocampal neurons using fast-application techniques and the open channel blocker MK-801. In the presence of MK-801, brief applications of L-glutamate or the low-affinity agonist L-cysteate resulted in a similar amount of block despite the much shorter period of channel activation by L-cysteate. A brief coapplication of L-glutamate and MK-801 resulted in a block similar to that found with an application of L-glutamate in a background of MK-801. These results, along with our findings that MK-801 does not block desensitized receptors, indicate that NMDA channels have a mean first latency of approximately 10 msec, consistent with a peak open probability near 0.3. If NMDA channels at synapses behave similarly, relatively few channels would be required to produce the postsynaptic calcium transient associated with synaptic plasticity and developmental regulation.},

The method utilizes the joint probability density of the observed dwell time sequence as likelihood. A forward-backward recursive procedure is developed for efficient computation of the likelihood function and its derivatives with respect to the model parameters. Based on the calculated forward and backward vectors, analytical formulae for the derivatives of the likelihood function are derived. The method exploits the variable metric optimizer for search of the likelihood space. It converges rapidly and is numerically stable. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the method.},

abstract = {The Ca2+-dependent retrograde inhibition of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (depolarization-induced-suppression of inhibition; DSI) was investigated using fura-2 Ca2+ measurements and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat cerebellar Purkinje cells. DSI was studied in cells loaded with different concentrations of the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA and EGTA. A concentration of 40 mM BAPTA was required to significantly interfere with DSI, whereas 10 mM BAPTA was almost ineffective. 40 mM EGTA reduced DSI, but was less effective than 40 mM BAPTA. Ratiometric Ca2+ measurements indicated that the extent of DSI depended critically on the changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). The relationship between DSI and peak Delta[Ca2+]i could be approximated by a hyperbolic function, with apparent half-saturation concentrations of 200 and 40 nM for dendritic and somatic [Ca2+]i, respectively. It is suggested that DSI is due to somatodendritic exocytosis of a retrograde messenger, and that this exocytosis is highly sensitive to [Ca2+]i.},

This requires new methods to image a live cell on the nanoscale. The scanned nanopipette can be used to obtain high resolution noncontact images of the surface of live cells under physiological conditions and has been used to develop a family of related methods that allow mapping of cell function on the nanoscale, and hence allow the relationship between cell structure and function to be probed. This is a powerful method to bridge the current gap between high resolution structures of individual molecular complexes and low resolution imaging of live cell structure and function.},

abstract = {This paper advocates expansion of the role of Bayesian statistical inference when formally quantifying uncertainty in computer models defined by systems of ordinary or partial differential equations. We adopt the perspective that implicitly defined infinite dimensional functions representing model states are objects to be inferred probabilistically. We develop a general methodology for the probabilistic integration of differential equations via model based updating of a joint prior measure on the space of functions and their temporal and spatial derivatives. This results in a posterior measure over functions reflecting how well they satisfy the system of differential equations and corresponding initial and boundary values. We show how this posterior measure can be naturally incorporated within the Kennedy and O'Hagan framework for uncertainty quantification and provides a fully Bayesian approach to model calibration. By taking this probabilistic viewpoint, the full force of Bayesian inference can be exploited when seeking to coherently quantify and propagate epistemic uncertainty in computer models of complex natural and physical systems. A broad variety of examples are provided to illustrate the potential of this framework for characterising discretization uncertainty, including initial value, delay, and boundary value differential equations, as well as partial differential equations. We also demonstrate our methodology on a large scale system, by modeling discretization uncertainty in the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid flow, reduced to over 16,000 coupled and stiff ordinary differential equations. Finally, we discuss the wide range of open research themes that follow from the work presented.},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that spontaneous changes in cerebral blood flow are primarily induced by changes in arterial pressure and that cerebral autoregulation is a frequency-dependent phenomenon, we measured mean arterial pressure in the finger and mean blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (VMCA) during supine rest and acute hypotension induced by thigh cuff deflation in 10 healthy subjects. Transfer function gain, phase, and coherence function between changes in arterial pressure and VMCA were estimated using the Welch method. The impulse response function, calculated as the inverse Fourier transform of this transfer function, enabled the calculation of transient changes in VMCA during acute hypotension, which was compared with the directly measured change in VMCA during thigh cuff deflation. Beat-to-beat changes in VMCA occurred simultaneously with changes in arterial pressure, and the autospectrum of VMCA showed characteristics similar to arterial pressure. Transfer gain increased substantially with increasing frequency from 0.07 to 0.20 Hz in association with a gradual decrease in phase. The coherence function was > 0.5 in the frequency range of 0.07-0.30 Hz and < 0.5 at < 0.07 Hz. Furthermore, the predicted change in VMCA was similar to the measured VMCA during thigh cuff deflation. These data suggest that spontaneous changes in VMCA that occur at the frequency range of 0.07-0.30 Hz are related strongly to changes in arterial pressure and, furthermore, that short-term regulation of cerebral blood flow in response to changes in arterial pressure can be modeled by a transfer function with the quality of a high-pass filter in the frequency range of 0.07-0.30 Hz.},

abstract = {Single channel currents through Ca2+-activated K+ channels of bovine chromaffin cells were measured to determine the effects of small ions on permeation through the channel. The channel selects strongly for K+ over Na+ and Cs+, and Rb+ carries a smaller current through the channel than K+. Tetraethylammonium ion (TEA+) blocks channel currents when applied to either side of the membrane; it is effective at lower concentrations when applied externally. Millimolar concentrations of internal Na+ reduce the average current through the channel and produce large fluctuations (flicker) in the open channel currents. This flickery block is analyzed by a new method, amplitude distribution analysis, which can measure block and unblock rates in the microsecond time range even though individual blocking events are not time-resolved by the recording system. The analysis shows that the rate of block by Na+ is very voltage dependent, but the unblock rate is voltage independent. These results can be explained easily by supposing that current flow through the channel is diffusion limited, a hypothesis consistent with the large magnitude of the single channel current.},

abstract = {Statistical inference on graphs is a burgeoning field in the applied and theoretical statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of science, engineering, business, etc. In many applications, we are faced with the reality of errorfully observed graphs. That is, the existence of an edge between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this paper, we consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. We wish to perform an inference task -- the {\it surrogate} inference task considered here is "vertex classification". However, we do not observe $G$; rather, for each potential edge $uv \in {{V}\choose{2}}$ we observe an "edge-feature" which we use to classify $uv$ as edge/not-edge. Thus we {\it errorfully} observe $G$ when we observe the graph $\widetilde{G} = (V,\widetilde{E})$. Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge-features we observe -- more informative edge-features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge-features. We derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off.},

abstract = {We have identified an excitatory synapse in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons at which the level of presynaptic activity determines the receptor type involved in the postsynaptic response. When small numbers of parallel fibers are activated, EPSCs are mediated solely by AMPA receptors (AMPARs), despite our finding that NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are present in the dendrites of these cells. The EPSC kinetics are fast (tau decay = 0.82 +/- 0.05 msec at room temperature), consistent with the role these interneurons are thought to play in precisely timed inhibitory control of Purkinje cells. NMDARs are activated only when glutamate release is increased either by facilitation with brief high-frequency trains or by recruiting more presynaptic fibers with higher stimulus intensities. Under these conditions, EPSCs consist of a fast-rising AMPAR-mediated current followed by a slow component mediated by both NMDARs and AMPARs. Inhibitors of glutamate transport increase the amplitude and prolong the time course of the compound EPSCs. In contrast, the properties of fast AMPAR EPSCs resulting from the activation of few inputs remain unchanged when glutamate uptake is blocked. Our results suggest that, at these synapses, the postsynaptic density contains AMPARs alone. It is only when transmitter release is high enough for glutamate to diffuse to the extrasynaptic space and to reach concentrations sufficient to activate extrasynaptic receptors that NMDARs are involved in the postsynaptic response. We suggest that such a spatial separation of receptor types may provide a mechanism for rapid changes in EPSC properties, depending on the amount of synaptic activity.},

abstract = {We have measured the changes in oxy-haemoglobin and deoxy-haemoglobin in the adult human brain during a brief finger tapping exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) can be estimated from these NIRS data provided certain model assumptions. The change in CMRO2 is related to changes in the total haemoglobin concentration, deoxy-haemoglobin concentration and blood flow. As NIRS does not provide a measure of dynamic changes in blood flow during brain activation, we relied on a Windkessel model that relates dynamic blood volume and flow changes, which has been used previously for estimating CMRO2 from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Because of the partial volume effect we are unable to quantify the absolute changes in the local brain haemoglobin concentrations with NIRS and thus are unable to obtain an estimate of the absolute CMRO2 change. An absolute estimate is also confounded by uncertainty in the flow-volume relationship. However, the ratio of the flow change to the CMRO2 change is relatively insensitive to these uncertainties. For the linger tapping task, we estimate a most probable flow-consumption ratio ranging from 1.5 to 3 in agreement with previous findings presented in the literature, although we cannot exclude the possibility that there is no CMRO2 change. The large range in the ratio arises from the large number of model parameters that must be estimated from the data. A more precise estimate of the flow-consumption ratio will require better estimates of the model parameters or flow information, as can be provided by combining NIRS with fMRI.},

abstract = {1. Postsynaptic currents originating from activation of the two major excitatory inputs to Purkinje cells were studied in thin slices of rat cerebellum, using the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. Two types of excitatory postsynaptic currents were analysed: those evoked by stimulation of the granule cell-parallel fibre system (PF-EPSC) and those elicited by stimulation of the climbing fibres (CF-EPSC). 2. Both types of postsynaptic currents had a linear current-voltage relation, reversing at membrane potentials close to 0 mV. Their time course of activation was independent of the membrane potential. 3. For both types of postsynaptic currents, the time course of decay was well described by a single exponential function, with a time constant which increased as the membrane potential was made more positive. 4. Postsynaptic currents arising from stimulation of the climbing fibre generally had a slightly faster time course of onset and decay than those associated with stimulation of the granule cell-parallel fibre system. The average values of the 10-90% rise time were 1.8 +/- 0.4 ms (means +/- S.D., n = 7) for PF-EPSCs and 0.8 +/- 0.3 ms (n = 9) for CF-EPSCs. Time constants of decay, at a holding potential of -60 mV, had values of 8.3 +/- 1.6 ms (n = 7) and 6.4 +/- 1.1 ms (n = 9) for PF-EPSCs and CF-EPSCs respectively. 5. CF-EPSCs and PF-EPSCs had the characteristics described above in slices derived from animals aged 9-22 days old and 9-15 days old, respectively. The PF-EPSCs in animals older than 15 days had very slow time courses and positive apparent reversal potentials, suggesting that they originated from distal locations, not under accurate voltage control. 6. In order to assess the quality of the voltage clamp, responses to hyperpolarizing pulses from -70 mV were analysed. The capacitive currents could be fitted by the sum of two exponentials, and were interpreted with an equivalent electrical circuit comprising two main compartments (soma and proximal dendrites on one hand, distal dendrites on the other). Analysis of synaptic currents in terms of this model suggested that the recorded time course of decay was approximately correct. 7. CF-EPSCs as well as PF-EPSCs were insensitive to the NMDA receptor antagonist 3-3(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonate (CPP), but were blocked in a dose-dependent reversible manner by the non-NMDA antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Currently there is a great interest in using scanning probe microscopy to study living cells. However, in most cases the contact the probe makes with the soft surface of the cell deforms or damages it. Here we report a scanning ion conductance microscope specially developed for imaging living cells. A key feature of the instrument is its scanning algorithm, which maintains the working distance between the probe and the sample such that they do not make direct physical contact with each other. Numerical simulation of the probe/sample interaction, which closely matches the experimental observations, provides the optimum working distance. The microscope scans highly convoluted surface structures without damaging them and reveals the true topography of cell surfaces. The images resemble those produced by scanning electron microscopy, with the significant difference that the cells remain viable and active. The instrument can monitor small-scale dynamics of cell surfaces as well as whole-cell movement.},

abstract = {1. Outside-out patches were isolated from granule cells of dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1 regions of rat hippocampal slices. Patches were exposed briefly to L-glutamate using a piezo-driven double-barrelled application pipette. 2. Applications of glutamate (1 mM) of 1 ms duration activated patch currents which rose and decayed rapidly. The 20-80% rise time of these glutamate receptor (GluR)-mediated currents was usually 0.2-0.6 ms. At -50 mV the peak current varied from 10 to 500 pA in different patches. 3. The peak current-voltage relation for brief pulses of 1 mM glutamate was virtually linear in normal extracellular solution for patches from the three cell types (-100 to 60 mV). 4. The permeability of GluR channels activated at the peak to Ca2+, relative to K+, was less than 0.1 for all three cell types (under bi-ionic conditions with Ca2+ on the extracellular side and K+ on the intracellular side of the membrane). 5. The offset decay time constant of the current following 1 ms pulses of 1 mM glutamate was brief, with mean values of 3.0 +/- 0.8, 2.5 +/- 0.7, and 2.3 +/- 0.7 ms for dentate, CA3 and CA1 cell patches, respectively. Offset time constants were independent of membrane potential and independent of glutamate concentration (200 microM and 1 mM) for the three cell types. 6. Applications of 1 mM glutamate of 100 ms duration showed that glutamate responses desensitized rapidly. The time constants for desensitization were 9.4 +/- 2.7, 11.3 +/- 2.8, and 9.3 +/- 2.8 ms for patches from dentate, CA3 and CA1 cells respectively. Desensitization time constants were only weakly dependent on glutamate concentration (200 microM and 1 mM) for the three cell types. Thus offset time constants are about four times faster than desensitization time constants for both glutamate concentrations. 7. Double pulse application of glutamate indicated that even a 1 ms pulse of 1 mM glutamate causes partial (about 60%) desensitization of GluR channels. The time course of recovery from desensitization was slower in dentate gyrus granule cell patches than in CA3 or CA1 pyramidal cell patches. 8. Desensitization was studied at equilibrium by exposing patches to low glutamate concentrations for at least 15 s before a 1 ms test pulse of 1 mM glutamate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Axon hillocks and initial segments have been recognized and studied in electron micrographs of a wide variety of neurons. In all multipolar neurons the fine structure of the initial segment has the same pattern, whether or not the axon is ensheathed in myelin. The internal structure of the initial segment is characterized by three special features: (a) a dense layer of finely granular material undercoating the plasma membrane, (b) scattered clusters of ribosomes, and (c) fascicles of microtubules. A similar undercoating occurs beneath the plasma membrane of myelinated axons at nodes of Ranvier. The ribosomes are not organized into Nissl bodies and are too sparsely distributed to produce basophilia. They vanish at the end of the initial segment. Fascicles of microtubules occur only in the axon hillock and initial segment and nowhere else in the neuron. Therefore, they are the principal identifying mark. Some speculations are presented on the relation between these special structural features and the special function of the initial segment.},

abstract = {Synaptic short-term plasticity is considered to result from multiple cellular mechanisms, which may include presynaptic and postsynaptic contributions. We have recently developed a nonstationary EPSC fluctuation analysis (Scheuss and Neher, 2001) to estimate synaptic parameters and their transient changes during short-term synaptic plasticity. Extending the classical variance-mean approach, a short train of stimuli is applied repetitively, and the resulting EPSCs are analyzed for means, variances, and covariances. This provides estimates of the quantal size and quantal content for each EPSC in the train, and furthermore, an estimate of the number of release sites. The latter is less sensitive to heterogeneity in the release probability than that of the variance-mean approach. Here, we applied this analysis to the calyx of Held synapse in brainstem slices of young rats (postnatal day 8-10). We found significant negative covariance in the amplitude of successive EPSCs in a train. The analysis showed that the 10-fold depression in the EPSC amplitude during 100 Hz trains at elevated extracellular Ca(2+) concentration resulted from a 2.5-fold reduction in quantal size caused by postsynaptic AMPA receptor desensitization and saturation, and a fourfold reduction in quantal content, which was partially relieved by application of cyclothiazide. The number of release sites estimated by covariance analysis was approximately 2000 and significantly larger than estimates from variance-mean parabolas.},

abstract = {Focusing of light in the diffusive regime inside scattering media has long been considered impossible. Recently, this limitation has been overcome with time reversal of ultrasound-encoded light (TRUE), but the resolution of this approach is fundamentally limited by the large number of optical modes within the ultrasound focus. Here, we introduce a new approach, time reversal of variance-encoded light (TROVE), which demixes these spatial modes by variance-encoding to break the resolution barrier imposed by the ultrasound. By encoding individual spatial modes inside the scattering sample with unique variances, we effectively uncouple the system resolution from the size of the ultrasound focus. This enables us to demonstrate optical focusing and imaging with diffuse light at unprecedented, speckle-scale lateral resolution of {\textasciitilde} 5 $\mu$m.},

abstract = {OBJECT:Recent observations indicate that traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. This, along with growing use of brain tissue PO2 monitors, has led to considerable interest in the potential use of ventilation with 100% oxygen to treat patients who have suffered a TBI. To date, the impact of normobaric hyperoxia has only been evaluated using indirect measures of its impact on brain metabolism. To determine if normobaric hyperoxia improves brain oxygen metabolism following acute TBI, the authors directly measured the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) with positron emission tomography before and after ventilation with 100% oxygen.

METHODS:Baseline measurements of arterial and jugular venous blood gases, mean arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume, oxygen extraction fraction, and CMRO2 were made at baseline while the patients underwent ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.3 to 0.5. The FiO2 was then increased to 1.0, and 1 hour later all measurements were repeated. Five patients were studied a mean of 17.9 +/- 5.8 hours (range 12-23 hours) after trauma. The median admission Glasgow Coma Scale score was 7 (range 3-9). During ventilation with 100% oxygen, there was a marked rise in PaO2 (from 117 +/- 31 to 371 +/- 99 mm Hg, p < 0.0001) and a small rise in arterial oxygen content (12.7 +/- 4.0 to 13.3 +/- 4.6 vol %, p = 0.03). There were no significant changes in systemic hemodynamic or other blood gas measurements. At the baseline evaluation, bihemispheric CBF was 39 +/- 12 ml/100 g/min and bihemispheric CMRO2 was 1.9 +/- 0.6 ml/ 100 g/min. During hyperoxia there was no significant change in either of these measurements. (Values are given as the mean +/- standard deviation throughout.)

CONCLUSIONS:Normobaric hyperoxia did not improve brain oxygen metabolism. In the absence of outcome data from clinical trials, these preliminary data do not support the use of 100% oxygen in patients with acute TBI, although larger confirmatory studies are needed.},

abstract = {Cell specialization is often governed by the spatial distribution of ion channels and receptors on the cell surface. So far, little is known about functional ion channel localization. This is due to a lack of satisfactory methods for investigating ion channels in an intact cell and simultaneously determining the channels' positions accurately. We have developed a novel high-resolution scanning patch-clamp technique that enables the study of ion channels, not only in small cells, such as sperm, but in submicrometer cellular structures, such as epithelial microvilli, fine neuronal dendrites, and, particularly, T-tubule openings of cardiac myocytes. In cardiac myocytes, as in most excitable cells, action potential propagation depends essentially on the properties of ion channels that are functionally and spatially coupled. We found that the L-type calcium and chloride channels are distributed and colocalized in the region of T-tubule openings, but not in other regions of the myocyte. In addition, chloride channels were found in narrowly defined regions of Z-grooves. This finding suggests a new synergism between these types of channels that may be relevant for action potential propagation along the T-tubule system and excitation-contraction coupling.},

abstract = {Substantial mean differences between arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) and end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2) in anesthesia and intensive care settings have been demonstrated by a number of investigators. We have explored the technical causes of error in the measurement of PETCO2 that could contribute to the observed differences. In a clinical setting, the measurement of PETCO2 is accomplished with one of three types of instruments, infrared analyzers, mass spectrometers, and Raman spectrometers, whose specified accuracies are typically +/- 2, +/- 1.5, and +/- 0.5 mm Hg, respectively. We examined potential errors in PETCO2 measurement with respect to the analyzer, sampling system, environment, and instrument. Various analyzer error sources were measured, including stability, warm-up time, interference from nitrous oxide and oxygen, pressure, noise, and response time. Other error sources, including calibration, resistance in the sample catheter, pressure changes, water vapor, liquid water, and end-tidal detection algorithms, were considered and are discussed. On the basis of our measurements and analysis, we estimate the magnitude of the major potential errors for an uncompensated infrared analyzer as: inaccuracy, 2 mm Hg; resolution, 0.5 mm Hg; noise, 2 mm Hg; instability (12 hours), 3 mm Hg; miscalibration, 1 mm Hg; selectivity (70% nitrous oxide), 6.5 mm Hg; selectivity (100% oxygen), -2.5 mm Hg; atmospheric pressure change, less than 1 mm Hg; airway pressure at 30 cm H2O, 2 mm Hg; positive end-expiratory pressure or continuous positive airway pressure at 20 cm H2O, 1.5 mm Hg; sampling system resistance, less than 1 mm Hg; and water vapor, 2.5 mm Hg. In addition to these errors, other systematic mistakes such as an inaccurate end-tidal detection algorithm, poor calibration technique, or liquid water contamination can lead to gross inaccuracies. In a clinical setting, unless the user is confident that all of the technical error sources have been eliminated and the physiologic factors are known, depending on PETCO2 to determine PaCO2 is not advised.},

abstract = {Mechanistic models based on systems of nonlinear differential equations can help provide a quantitative understanding of complex physical or biological phenomena. The use of such models to describe nonlinear interactions in molecular biology has a long history; however, it is only recently that advances in computing have allowed these models to be set within a statistical framework, further increasing their usefulness and binding modelling and experimental approaches more tightly together. A probabilistic approach to modelling allows us to quantify uncertainty in both the model parameters and the model predictions, as well as in the model hypotheses themselves. In this paper, the Bayesian approach to statistical inference is adopted and we examine the significant challenges that arise when performing inference over nonlinear ordinary differential equation models describing cell signalling pathways and enzymatic circadian control; in particular, we address the difficulties arising owing to strong nonlinear correlation structures, high dimensionality and non-identifiability of parameters. We demonstrate how recently introduced differential geometric Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology alleviates many of these issues by making proposals based on local sensitivity information, which ultimately allows us to perform effective statistical analysis. Along the way, we highlight the deep link between the sensitivity analysis of such dynamic system models and the underlying Riemannian geometry of the induced posterior probability distributions.},

abstract = {Using patch-clamp techniques, a hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) was recorded from synaptic terminals of mouse cerebellar basket cells. Ih was blocked quickly and reversibly by 2 mM Cs(+), and subtraction revealed a rapidly activating and deactivating I(h) current. Similar gating and block of presynaptic I(h) were also seen with the more selective inhibitor ZD 7288 (10 microM). The time constant of activation (tau (a))of presynaptic I(h) current became faster with membrane hyperpolarization, being approximately 74 ms at -130 mV, changing e-fold for a 33 mV change in membrane potential. Whole-cell recordings from basket cell somata also revealed an I(h) current, which was similarly sensitive to block by ZD 7288. Inhibition of I(h) by 10 microM ZD 7288 reduced the frequency ( approximately 34 %) and amplitude ( approximately 26 %) of spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) recorded in Purkinje cells, one of the principal synaptic targets of basket neurones. This is the first report of an I(h) current in mammalian inhibitory presynaptic terminals, which may be an important target for neuromodulation in the cerebellum. Comparing the biophysical properties and distribution of cloned hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, we also suggest a molecular candidate underlying I(h) at these synapses.},

abstract = {Neurotransmitters acting on presynaptic terminals regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Because of the difficulty of direct electrophysiological recording from small presynaptic terminals, little is known about the ion channels that mediate these actions or about the mechanisms by which transmitter secretion is altered. The patch-clamp technique is used to show that the predominant inhibitory presynaptic neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), activates a GABAA receptor and gates a chloride channel in the membranes of peptidergic nerve terminals of the posterior pituitary. The opening of a chloride channel by GABA weakly depolarizes the nerve terminal membrane and blocks action potentials. In this way, GABA limits secretion by retarding the spread of excitation into the terminal arborization.},

abstract = {Time series prediction techniques have been used in many real-world applications such as financial market prediction, electric utility load forecasting , weather and environmental state prediction, and reliability forecasting. The underlying system models and time series data generating processes are generally complex for these applications and the models for these systems are usually not known a priori. Accurate and unbiased estimation of the time series data produced by these systems cannot always be achieved using well known linear techniques, and thus the estimation process requires more advanced time series prediction algorithms. This paper provides a survey of time series prediction applications using a novel machine learning approach: support vector machines (SVM). The underlying motivation for using SVMs is the ability of this methodology to accurately forecast time series data when the underlying system processes are typically nonlinear, non-stationary and not defined a-priori. SVMs have also been proven to outperform other non-linear techniques including neural-network based non-linear prediction techniques such as multi-layer perceptrons.The ultimate goal is to provide the reader with insight into the applications using SVM for time series prediction, to give a brief tutorial on SVMs for time series prediction, to outline some of the advantages and challenges in using SVMs for time series prediction, and to provide a source for the reader to locate books, technical journals, and other online SVM research resources.

abstract = {The brain contains an astonishing diversity of neurons, each expressing only one set of ion channels out of the billions of potential channel combinations. Simple organizing principles are required for us to make sense of this abundance of possibilities and wealth of related data. We suggest that energy minimization subject to functional constraints may be one such unifying principle. We compared the energy needed to produce action potentials singly and in trains for a wide range of channel densities and kinetic parameters and examined which combinations of parameters maximized spiking function while minimizing energetic cost. We confirmed these results for sodium channels using a dynamic current clamp in neocortical fast spiking interneurons. We find further evidence supporting this hypothesis in a wide range of other neurons from several species and conclude that the ion channels in these neurons minimize energy expenditure in their normal range of spiking.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To function as a transport barrier a renal tubule epithelial monolayer needs to maintain its integrity when, sudden hypertonic stress causes cell shrinkage, new cells are added, or cells in the monolayer die. However, the mechanism used to achieve this is largely unknown. Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) has been shown to be suitable for imaging the surface of live renal cells with high topographic resolution, and can be used to elucidate how a functional renal epithelial monolayer maintains its integrity. METHODS: SICM was used for high spatial resolution topographic imaging of Xenopuslaevis renal epithelial A6 cells cultured on membrane filter inserts. RESULTS: The SICM images of A6 cells showed that the epithelial monolayer maintains its integrity under hypertonic stress, and during cell division and death. Sequential SICM topographic images revealed detailed structural changes and their time course for these protective processes, which involve highly cooperative cell movement. Some "balloon-like" structures were observed at susceptible tight junction regions, which were proposed to help cell maintaining the monolayer permeability integrity. CONCLUSION: SICM is a powerful tool for research on living renal epithelial cells, and has been used to elucidate how a functional epithelial monolayer maintains its integrity. Using this technique we have observed that during hypertonic stress and regeneration, an organized sequence of events protect the loss of integrity of monolayer so that tight junctions and cell-cell contact are maintained and disruption to the function of whole monolayer is prevented.},

abstract = {1. The dynamic model of oxidative phosphorylation developed previously for rat liver mitochondria incubated with succinate was adapted for muscle mitochondria respiring on pyruvate. We introduced the following changes considering: (1) a higher external ATP/ADP ratio and an ATP/ADP carrier less displaced from equilibrium; (2) a substrate dehydrogenation more sensitive to the NADH/NAD+ ratio; and (3) the respiratory chain, ATP synthase and phosphate carrier being more displaced from equilibrium. The experimental flux control coefficients already determined in state 3 for respiratory rate and ATP synthesis were used to adjust some parameters. This new oxidative phosphorylation model enabled us to simulate the whole titration curves obtained experimentally in state 3. These curves, which mimic the effect of mitochondrial complex deficiencies on oxidative phosphorylation, show a threshold effect, which is reproduced by the model. 2. the model was also used to simulate other physiological conditions such as (i) state 3.5, conditions in-between state 4 and state 3; and (ii) hypoxic conditions. In both cases a profound change in the pattern of the control coefficients was shown. 3. This model was thus found useful in investigating a variety of new conditions, the most interesting of which can then be experimentally studied.},

abstract = {Here we describe the use of pulse-mode scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) to observe volume changes and cell membrane movements during the locomotion of cultured cells in the range of minutes to several hours. The microscope is based on the pulse-mode SICM previously developed for stable imaging of single cells in culture. Our instrument uses current pulses to control the distance between cell surface and electrode tip as well as a back-step mode to prevent contact of tip and membrane during lateral movements of the probe. We performed repeated scans of cell surfaces using feedback-controlled piezoactors to position the electrode. Using patch-clamp-type electrode tips the height of cells could reproducibly be measured with a standard deviation of 50 nm. To quantify and separate changes in cell position and volume occurring between consecutive scans, a program was written to subtract images and calculate volume changes. Examples of repeated scans show that membrane movements in the range of 30 min to a few hours can be quantitatively monitored with a lateral resolution of 500 nm using difference images and that faster movements in the range of minutes can be recorded at defined cell sections using the line scan mode. Difference images indicate that volume changes can affect cell surfaces inhomogeneously, emphasizing the role of the cytoskeleton in the stabilization of cell shape.},

abstract = {All animal cell types have an appropriate volume. Even under physiological conditions of constant extracellular osmolarity, cells must regulate their volume. Cell volume is subjected to alterations because of persistent physicochemical osmotic load resulting from Donnan-type colloid osmotic pressure and of cell activity-associated changes in intracellular osmolarity resulting from osmolyte transport and metabolism. The strategy adopted by animal cells for coping with volume regulation on osmotic perturbation is to activate transport pathways, including channels and transporters, mainly for inorganic osmolytes to drive water flow. Under normotonic conditions, cells undergo volume regulation by pump-mediated mechanisms. Under anisotonic conditions, volume regulation occurs by additional channel/transporter-mediated mechanisms. Cell volume regulation is also attained through adjustment of intracellular levels not only of inorganic but also of organic osmolytes with changing the expression of their transporters or regulation of metabolism. In cell volume regulation mechanism, several "volume sensors" are thought to be involved. A volume-sensitive Cl- channel has lately attracted considerable attention in this regard.},

abstract = {1. The aim of the study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the depressant effect of the group I/II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) agonist 1S,3R-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (1S,3R-ACPD) on parallel fibre (PF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synaptic transmission. Experiments were performed in rat cerebellar slices using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and fluorometric measurements of presynaptic calcium variation 2. Analysis of short-term plasticity, fluctuation of EPSC amplitude and responses of PCs to exogenous glutamate showed that depression caused by 1S,3R-ACPD is presynaptic. 3. The effects of 1S,3R-ACPD were blocked and reproduced by group I mGluR antagonists and agonists, respectively. 4. These effects remained unchanged in mGluR5 knock-out mice and disappeared in mGluR1 knock-out mice. 5. 1S,3R-ACPD increased calcium concentration in PFs. This effect was abolished by AMPA/kainate (but not NMDA) receptor antagonists and mimicked by focally applied agonists of these receptors. Thus, it is not directly due to mGluRs but to presynaptic AMPA/kainate receptors indirectly activated by 1S,3R-ACPD. 6. Frequencies of spontaneous and evoked unitary EPSCs recorded in PCs were respectively increased and decreased by mGluR1 agonists. Similar results were obtained when mGluR1s were activated by tetanic stimulation of PFs. 7. Injecting 30 mM BAPTA into PCs blocked the effects of 1S,3R-ACPD on unitary EPSCs. 8. In conclusion, 1S,3R-ACPD reduces evoked release of glutamate from PFs. This effect is triggered by postsynaptic mGluR1s and thus implies that a retrograde messenger, probably glutamate, opens presynaptic AMPA/kainate receptors and consequently increases spontaneous release of glutamate from PF terminals and decreases evoked synaptic transmission.},

abstract = {Calcium-activated potassium channels are fundamental regulators of neuronal excitability, participating in interspike interval and spike-frequency adaptation. For large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels, recent experiments have illuminated the fundamental biophysical mechanisms of gating, demonstrating that BK channels are voltage gated and calcium modulated. Structurally, BK channels have been shown to possess an extracellular amino-terminal domain, different from other potassium channels. Domains and residues involved in calcium-gating, and perhaps calcium binding itself, have been identified. For small- and intermediate-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels, SK and IK channels, clones have only recently become available, and they show that SK channels are a distinct subfamily of potassium channels. The biophysical properties of SK channels demonstrate that kinetic differences between apamin-sensitive and apamin-insensitive slow afterhyperpolarizations are not attributable to intrinsic gating differences between the two subtypes. Interestingly, SK and IK channels may prove effective drug targets for diseases such as myotonic muscular dystrophy and sickle cell anemia.},

abstract = {Cooperativity among the four subunits helps give rise to the remarkable voltage sensitivity of Shaker potassium channels, whose open probability changes tenfold for a 5-mV change in membrane potential. The cooperativity in these channels is thought to arise from a concerted structural transition as the final step in opening the channel. Recordings of single-channel ionic currents from certain other channel types, as well as our previous recordings from T442S mutant Shaker channels, however, display intermediate conductance levels in addition to the fully open and closed states. These sublevels might represent stepwise, rather than concerted, transitions in the final steps of channel activation. Here, we report a similar fine structure in the closing transitions of Shaker channels lacking the mutation. Describing the deactivation time course with hidden Markov models, we find that two subconductance levels are rapidly traversed during most closing transitions of chimeric, high conductance Shaker channels. The lifetimes of these levels are voltage-dependent, with maximal values of 52 and 22 micros at -100 mV, and the voltage dependences of transitions among these states suggest that they arise from equivalent conformational changes occurring in individual subunits. At least one subconductance level is found to be traversed in normal conductance Shaker channels. We speculate that voltage-dependent conformational changes in the subunits give rise to changes in a "pore gate" associated with the selectivity filter region of the channel, producing the subconductance states. As a control for the hidden Markov analysis, we applied the same procedures to recordings of the recovery from N-type inactivation in Shaker channels. These transitions are found to be instantaneous in comparison.},

abstract = {The microscopically complicated real world exhibits behavior that often yields to simple yet quantitatively accurate descriptions. Predictions are possible despite large uncertainties in microscopic parameters, both in physics and in multiparameter models in other areas of science. We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion) and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally.},

abstract = {We examined the neuroprotective actions of the glycine site N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, 7-chlorokynurenate, in murine neocortical cell cultures. Cultures exposed for 5 min to 100 - 500 microM NMDA in the absence of added glycine developed substantial neuronal degeneration over the next 24 h. The addition of 10 microM glycine did not increase submaximal NMDA-induced neuronal injury, suggesting that endogenous glycine levels were sufficient to saturate its receptor sites on NMDA receptor complexes. Addition of 3 - 300 microM 7-chlorokynurenate produced concentration-dependent reduction in this neuronal damage with an IC50 of approximately 30 microM. Some injury reduction was seen even if the drug was added after completion of the NMDA exposure. The protective effect of 100 microM 7-chlorokynurenate could be overcome by adding 10 - 1000 microM glycine (glycine median effective concentration (EC50) approximately 100 microM) or 1 mM D-serine. As predicted by its ability to block NMDA receptor-mediated injury, 10 - 300 microM 7-chlorokynurenate also produced concentration-dependent reduction in the neuronal loss induced by 50 - 60 min exposure to combined glucose and oxygen deprivation. These data support the suggestion that pharmacologic interference with the binding of glycine to the NMDA receptor complex represents a potentially effective approach to blocking NMDA receptor-induced neurotoxicity in ischemia.},

In contrast to most previous algorithms, our method is provably convergent. By marrying convergent EP ideas from (Opper{\&}Winther 05) with covariance decoupling techniques (Wipf{\&}Nagarajan 08, Nickisch{\&}Seeger 09), it runs at least an order of magnitude faster than the most commonly used EP solver.},

abstract = {A new method, conductance scanning, allows determination of local para- and transcellular conductivities in flat epithelia. Experiments were performed on kidney distal tubule cells, MDCK clone C11, which form monolayers on permeable supports. Above the apical surface, local voltage drops generated by a sinusoidal current clamp were recorded by means of a scanning microelectrode. Data were collected above cell centres and tight junctions. The scanning signal was always significantly higher above the tight junctions, but was uniformly distributed along the junctions. For determination of conductivities two procedures were applied. Method 1: the supraepithelial potential distribution was computed for given trans- and paracellular currents at all positions of the electrode. In a fit algorithm, the currents were varied until the calculated potential difference equalled the voltage measured. Method 2: after collecting scanning data in control Ringer's, intercellular space width was reduced by mucosal addition of 40 mM sucrose and a second set of data was obtained at decreased paracellular, but presumably unchanged transcellular, conductivity. From these data, trans- and paracellular conductivities were calculated. Results of both methods were in excellent agreement. Confluent MDCK-C11 monolayers exhibited a transepithelial conductivity of 13 mS/cm2. The transcellular pathway contributed 2.6 mS/cm2 (20%) and the paracellular pathway 10. 5 mS/cm2 (80%) to the total conductivity. Collapse of the lateral intercellular spaces decreased the paracellular conductivity to 4 mS/cm2 (60%). Confluent MDCK-C11 monolayers constitute true "leaky" epithelia with homogeneously distributed trans- and paracellular conductivities. In conclusion, conductance scanning fills a methodical gap, which hitherto impeded the functional characterization of tight junctions.},

abstract = {1. Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells of hippocampal slices of 15- to 24-day-old rats (22 degrees C) using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. 2. Composite EPSCs were evoked by extracellular stimulation of the mossy fibre tract. Using the selective blockers 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV), a major alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor-mediated component and a minor NMDA receptor-mediated component with slower time course were distinguished. For the AMPA/kainate receptor-mediated component, the peak current-voltage (I-V) relation was linear, with a reversal potential close to 0 mV. The half-maximal blocking concentration of CNQX was 353 nM. 3. Unitary EPSCs of the mossy fibre terminal (MF)-CA3 pyramidal cell synapse were evoked at membrane potentials of -70 to -90 mV by low-intensity extracellular stimulation of granule cell somata using fine-tipped pipettes. The EPSC peak amplitude as a function of stimulus intensity showed all-or-none behaviour. The region of low threshold was restricted to a few micrometres. This suggests that extracellular stimulation was focal, and that the stimulus-evoked EPSCs were unitary. 4. Latency and rise time histograms of EPSCs evoked by granule cell stimulation showed narrow unimodal distributions within each experiment. The mean latency was 4.2 +/- 1.0 ms, and the mean 20-80% rise time was 0.6 +/- 0.1 ms (23 cells). When fitted within the range 0.7 ms to 20 ms after the peak, the decay of the EPSCs with the fastest rise (rise time 0.5 ms or less) could be described by a single exponential function; the mean time constant was in the range 3.0-6.6 ms with a mean of 4.8 ms (8 cells). 5. Peak amplitudes of the EPSCs evoked by suprathreshold granule cell stimulation fluctuated between trials. The apparent EPSC peak conductance in normal extracellular solution (2 mM Ca2+, 1 mM Mg2+), excluding failures, was 1 nS. Reducing the Ca2+ concentration and increasing the Mg2+ concentration reduced the mean peak amplitude in a concentration-dependent manner. 6. Peaks in EPSC peak amplitude distributions were apparent in low Ca2+ and high Mg2+. Using the criteria of equidistance and the presence of peaks and dips in the autocorrelation function, five of nine EPSC peak amplitude distributions were judged to be quantal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Regulation of GABA release is crucial for normal brain functioning, and GABAA-mediated IPSCs are strongly influenced by repetitive stimulation and neuromodulation. However, GABA exocytosis has not been examined directly in organized tissue. Important issues remain outside the realm of electrophysiological techniques or are complicated by postsynaptic factors. For example, it is not known whether all presynaptic modulators affect release from all boutons in the same way, or whether modulator effects depend on the presence of certain types of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). To address such issues, we used confocal imaging and styryl dyes to monitor exocytosis from identified GABAergic boutons in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Repetitively evoked IPSCs declined more rapidly and completely than exocytosis, suggesting that depletion of filled vesicles cannot fully account for IPSC depression and underscoring the usefulness of directly imaging exocytosis. Stimulation at 10 Hz produced a transient facilitation of exocytosis that was dependent on L-type VGCCs. Using specific toxins, we found that release mediated via N-type and P-type VGCCs had similar properties. Neither baclofen nor a cannabinoid receptor agonist, CP55940, affected all boutons uniformly; they slowed release from some but completely prevented detectable release from others. Increasing stimulus frequency overcame this blockade of release. However, baclofen and CP55940 did not act identically, because only baclofen reduced facilitation and affected bouton releasing via P/Q-type VGCCs. Direct observation thus revealed novel features of GABAergic exocytosis and its regulation that would have been difficult or impossible to detect electrophysiologically. These features advance the understanding of the regulation of synapses and networks by presynaptic inhibition.},

abstract = {Axo-dendritic synaptogenesis was examined in live hippocampal cell cultures using the fluorescent dyes DiO to label dendrites and FM 4-64 to label functional presynaptic boutons. As the first functional synaptic boutons appeared in these cultures, numerous filopodia (up to 10 micron long) were observed to extend transiently (mean lifetime 9.5 min) from dendritic shafts. With progressively increasing numbers of boutons, there were coincident decreases in numbers of transient filopodia and increases in numbers of stable dendritic spines. Dendritic filopodia were observed to initiate physical contacts with nearby axons. This sometimes resulted in filopodial stabilization and formation of functional presynaptic boutons. These findings suggest that dendritic filopodia may actively initiate synaptogenic contacts with nearby (5-10 micron) axons and thereafter evolve into dendritic spines.},

abstract = {One of the central problems in systems neuroscience is to understand how neural spike trains convey sensory information. Decoding methods, which provide an explicit means for reading out the information contained in neural spike responses, offer a powerful set of tools for studying the neural coding problem. Here we develop several decoding methods based on point-process neural encoding models, or forward models that predict spike responses to stimuli. These models have concave log-likelihood functions, which allow efficient maximum-likelihood model fitting and stimulus decoding. We present several applications of the encoding model framework to the problem of decoding stimulus information from population spike responses: (1) a tractable algorithm for computing the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the stimulus, the most probable stimulus to have generated an observed single- or multiple-neuron spike train response, given some prior distribution over the stimulus; (2) a gaussian approximation to the posterior stimulus distribution that can be used to quantify the fidelity with which various stimulus features are encoded; (3) an efficient method for estimating the mutual information between the stimulus and the spike trains emitted by a neural population; and (4) a framework for the detection of change-point times (the time at which the stimulus undergoes a change in mean or variance) by marginalizing over the posterior stimulus distribution. We provide several examples illustrating the performance of these estimators with simulated and real neural data.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of obtaining magnetic resonance-measured cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization (MR-CMRO(2)) in acute ischemic stroke patients. Seven stroke patients were serially imaged: 4.5 +/- 0.9 hours (tp1), 3 to 5 days (tp2), and 1 to 3 months (tp3) after symptom onset. Diffusion-weighted, perfusion-weighted, and multiecho gradient-echo/spin-echo images were acquired; cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction maps were obtained from which CMRO(2) was calculated as the product of cerebral blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction. The final infarct lesions obtained from tp3 T2-weighted images and the "penumbra" obtained from the tp1 perfusion-weighted image-defined lesion were coregistered onto tp1 CMRO(2) maps. CMRO(2) values in the region of brain that eventually infarcted were reduced to 0.40 +/- 0.24 of the respective region on the contralateral hemisphere. The "salvaged penumbra" defined by the area of mismatch between the final infarct and the tp1 perfusion-weighted lesion demonstrated an average CMRO(2) value of 0.55 +/- 0.11 of the contralateral hemisphere. Although our results are preliminary and require further evaluation, the ability to obtain in vivo measurements of MR-CMRO(2) noninvasively potentially can provide information for determining brain tissue viability in acute ischemic stroke patients.},

Dendritic spines, the locus of excitatory interaction among central neurons, are prime candidates for long-term synaptic modifications. We now present evidence that links phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) to formation of new spines; exposure to estradiol doubles the density of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons, and concomitantly causes a large increase in phosphorylated CREB and in CREB binding protein. Blockade of cAMP-regulated protein kinase A eliminates estradiol-evoked spine formation, as well as the CREB and CREB binding protein responses. A specific antisense oligonucleotide eliminates the phosphorylated CREB response to estradiol as well as the formation of new dendritic spines. These results indicate that CREB phosphorylation is a necessary step in the process leading to generation of new dendritic spines.},

abstract = {Estradiol has been shown to cause an increase in dendritic spine density in cultured hippocampal neurons, an effect mediated by downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and the subsequent phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in response to enhanced activity levels. Interestingly, progesterone was shown to counteract the effects of estradiol on dendritic spine density in vivo and in vitro. The present study examined how progesterone may act to block the effects of estradiol in the molecular cascade of cellular events leading to formation of dendritic spines. Progesterone did not affect the estradiol-induced downregulation of BDNF or GAD, but it did block the effect of estradiol on CREB phosphorylation. The latter effects of progesterone on the pCREB response and spine formation were reversed by indomethacin, which prevents the conversion of progesterone to the neurosteroid tetrahydroprogesterone (THP). We therefore examined if the progesterone effects were caused by its active metabolite THP. Progesterone treatment caused a 60-fold increase in THP in the culture medium. THP itself enhanced spontaneous GABAergic activity in patch-clamped cultured neurons. Finally, THP blocked the estradiol-induced increase in spine density. These results suggest that progesterone, through conversion to THP, blocks the effects of estradiol on dendritic spines not via a direct nuclear receptor interaction but by counteracting the enhanced excitability produced by estradiol in the cultured network.},

abstract = {The characterization of the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-47 gene recently allowed the identification of a mammalian (gamma)-amino butyric acid (GABA) transporter, presumed to be located in the synaptic vesicle membrane. In situ hybridization data in rat brain suggested that it might also take up glycine and thus represent a general Vesicular Inhibitory Amino Acid Transporter (VIAAT). In the present study, we have investigated the localization of VIAAT in neurons by using a polyclonal antibody raised against the hydrophilic N-terminal domain of the protein. Light microscopy and immunocytochemistry in primary cultures or tissue sections of the rat spinal cord revealed that VIAAT was localized in a subset (63-65%) of synaptophysin-immunoreactive terminal boutons; among the VIAAT-positive terminals around motoneuronal somata, 32.9% of them were also immunoreactive for GAD65, a marker of GABAergic presynaptic endings. Labelling was also found apposed to clusters positive for the glycine receptor or for its associated protein gephyrin. At the ultrastructural level, VIAAT immunoreactivity was restricted to presynaptic boutons exhibiting classical inhibitory features and, within the boutons, concentrated over synaptic vesicle clusters. Pre-embedding detection of VIAAT followed by post-embedding detection of GABA or glycine on serial sections of the spinal cord or cerebellar cortex indicated that VIAAT was present in glycine-, GABA- or GABA- and glycine-containing boutons. Taken together, these data further support the view of a common vesicular transporter for these two inhibitory transmitters, which would be responsible for their costorage in the same synaptic vesicle and subsequent corelease at mixed GABA-and-glycine synapses.},

abstract = {1. Single-channel currents evoked in outside-out membrane patches from rat cerebellar granule cells by glutamate, aspartate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate and quisqualate were studied. Each agonist produced openings to five discrete amplitude levels. At a membrane potential of -70 mV, these levels correspond to single-channel conductances of about 8, 17, 30, 40 and 50 pS. NMDA, aspartate and glutamate evoked mainly 50 pS openings and also substantial numbers of 40 pS events. Kainate evoked primarily 8 and 17 pS openings. 2. The relative proportion of openings to each conductance level showed no dependence on membrane potential. At membrane potentials negative to -100 mV, current-voltage plots for 30, 40 and 50 pS openings showed substantial inward rectification. 3. With NMDA, aspartate and glutamate, the most common type of direct transition was between the 50 pS open level and the shut level. Transitions between the 30, 40 and 50 pS levels were also relatively common. With few exceptions, 8 and 17 pS openings appeared to arise directly from, and return directly to, the shut level. The differences between granule cells and certain other central neurones, in the types of transitions associated with NMDA receptor channels, provide evidence for the existence of more than one type of NMDA receptor. 4. Four exponential components were identified consistently in the shut-time distributions that were obtained with NMDA, aspartate and glutamate. Mean time constants for the briefest two components were 30 to 65 microseconds and 0.65 to 1.00 ms. The mean duration of these 'gaps within bursts' differed for different agonists, but did not vary with membrane potential. 5. Two exponential components were distinguished in most open-time distributions for the 50 pS level (time constants, 0.9-1.2 and 3.2-3.9 ms at -100 mV), whereas open-time distributions for 30 and 40 pS events were described adequately by single exponentials with time constants below 1.0 ms. The duration of 50 pS openings decreased with hyperpolarization. 6. Mean open times for 8 and 17 pS events produced by NMDA, aspartate and glutamate were 0.3 to 0.7 ms. The longest such openings were observed with quisqualate. 7. Three exponential components were present in distributions of burst length, and of total open time per burst, that were obtained with NMDA, aspartate and glutamate. The slowest two burst-length components had mean time constants of 1.7-2.4 and 10.6-13.0 ms and originated from the kinetic behaviour of the 50 pS state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Living motor nerve terminals from several species can be stained in an activity-dependent fashion by certain styryl dyes, such as RH414, RH795, and a new dye, FM1-43, which can be imaged independently of the others. The dyes evidently become trapped within recycled synaptic vesicles. In frog cutaneus pectoris muscle, bright fluorescent spots spaced regularly along the length of the nerve terminals appear after stimulation in the presence of the dye. The spots align well with postsynaptic ACh receptors and are persistent for many hours, unless further stimulation is given, in which case the spots disappear. Destaining, like staining, requires transmitter release and proceeds gradually over several minutes at high stimulus frequencies (e.g., 30 Hz), and fluorescent spots in the same terminal disappear at about the same rate. We suggest that each spot is a cluster of hundred of synaptic vesicles and that the mechanism of staining involves the ability of the dyes to partition reversibly into the outer leaflet of surface membranes, without being able to penetrate the entire membrane thickness. Then, during endocytosis following transmitter release, dye molecules become trapped in recycled synaptic vesicle membranes. The dyes therefore make it possible optically to study vesicle exocytosis and recycling in living nerve terminals in real time, and should be useful for marking terminals in a variety of preparations according to their level of activity.},

abstract = {In the preceding paper (Moore {\&} Westerfield, 1983) the effects of changes in membrane properties and non-uniform geometry on impulse propagation and threshold parameters were investigated. In this paper the contributions of these and other parameters to the site of initiation of an impulse were determined by computer simulations using the Hodgkin-Huxley membrane description, the cable equations, and geometry appropriate for a simplified motoneurone with a non-myelinated axon. Antidromic invasion of action potentials into the soma was found to depend upon (a) the ionic channel rate constants (determined by the temperature), (b) the abruptness of the transition from the small-diameter axon to the larger diameter (and increased load) of the soma-dendrite, (c) extensions of active properties into the dendrite, and (d) density of ion channels. The location of the apparent site of initiation of impulses was not necessarily at the site of synaptic input nor the nearest active membrane. Its position depended upon (a) the fraction of the dendritic tree with excitable membrane, and secondarily on (b) the stimulus strength. Even with uniform excitability in the active membrane, the apparent site of initiation could be moved a considerable distance from the soma and the site of stimulation by appropriate choice of the various parameters noted above.},

abstract = {1. The single sodium channel conductance gamma and the number of channels N were estimated from fluctuation analysis in voltage-clamped nodes of Ranvier under conditions that decreased the size of the sodium current. 2. Reduction of the sodium current by depolarizing prepulses had no effect on gamma, and, in cases where it could be determined, had no significant effect on N. Partial block of the sodium conductance with tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin also did not affect gamma significantly, but reduced N. 3. gamma was reduced to about 40% of the control value at -5 mV when the pH of the external solution was reduced to 5.0. The pH dependence of gamma is consistent with the theories of Woodhull and of Drouin {\&} Neumcke. 4. The differing effects of prepulses, toxins and pH are interpreted in view of the different time scales of channel inactivation or block under these conditions. 5. The nearly unchanged gamma with prepulses and partial toxin block provides further evidence for the absence of interactions among sodium channels.},

abstract = {Many recent statistical applications involve inference under complex models, where it is computationally prohibitive to calculate likelihoods but possible to simulate data. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is devoted to these complex models because it bypasses evaluations of the likelihood function using comparisons between observed and simulated summary statistics. We introduce the R abc package that implements several ABC algorithms for performing parameter estimation and model selection. In particular, the recently developed non-linear heteroscedastic regression methods for ABC are implemented. The abc package also includes a cross-validation tool for measuring the accuracy of ABC estimates, and to calculate the misclassification probabilities when performing model selection. The main functions are accompanied by appropriate summary and plotting tools. Considering an example of demographic inference with population genetics data, we show the potential of the R package. R is already widely used in bioinformatics and several fields of biology. The R abc package will make the ABC algorithms available to the large number of R users. abc is a freely available R package under the GPL license, and it can be downloaded at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html.},

We report here a novel technique based on scanning ion conductance microscopy that allows, for the first time, mapping of single active ion channels in intact cell plasma membranes. We have mapped the distribution of ATP-regulated K+ channels (KATP channels) in cardiac myocytes. The channels are organized in small groups and anchored in the Z-grooves of the sarcolemma. The distinct pattern of distribution of these channels may have important functional implications.},

Modeled optical data were converted into tissue ICG concentration using either the one-detector modified Beer-Lambert law (MBLL) method, or the two-detector partial path-length (PPL) method. The CBFs were estimated using deconvolution and blood flow index techniques. Using the MBLL method, the CBFs were significantly underestimated but the PPL method improved their accuracy and robustness, especially when used as relative measures. The dispersion of the arterial input function also affected the CBF estimates.},

To this end, this paper uncovers dynamic spatiotemporal patterns emerging from electrically stimulated neuronal cultures using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to characterize multi-channel spike trains as a progression of patterns of underlying states of neuronal activity. However, experimentation aimed at optimal choice of parameters for such models is essential and results are reported in detail. Results derived from ensemble neuronal data revealed highly repeatable patterns of state transitions in the order of milliseconds in response to probing stimuli.},

In an attempt to elucidate the protein composition of PSD, we have sequenced a 35 kDa protein of the rat forebrain PSD fraction. Amino acid sequence information of the tryptic peptides and immunoblot analyses revealed that the protein is a voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1). VDAC1 was enriched in the PSD fraction and was partially soluble in 1% n-octyl glucoside (NOG) or Triton X-100. Our data indicate that VDAC1, which is originally found in the outer mitochondrial membrane, is also present in the central nervous system (CNS) synapses in association with the PSD 'core'.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Vasospasm is a common complication of aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that may lead to cerebral ischemia and death. The standard method for detection of vasospasm is conventional cerebral angiography, which is invasive and does not allow continuous monitoring of arterial radius. Monitoring of vasospasm is typically performed by measuring Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity (CBFV) in the major cerebral arteries and calculating the Lindegaard ratio. We describe an alternative approach to estimate intracranial arterial radius, which is based on modeling and state-estimation techniques. The objective is to obtain a better estimation than that offered by the Lindegaard ratio, that might allow for continuous monitoring and possibly vasospam prediction without the need for angiography.

METHODS:We propose two new models of cerebral hemodynamics. Model 1 is a more general version of Ursino's 1991 model that includes the effects of vasospasm, and Model 2 is a simplified version of Model 1. We use Model 1 to generate Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and CBFV signals for different vasospasm conditions, where CBFV is measured at the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Then we use Model 2 to estimate the arterial radii from these signals.

FINDINGS:Simulations show that Model 2 is capable of providing good estimates for the radius of the MCA, allowing the detection of the vasospasm. These changes in arterial radius are being estimated from measurements of CBFV, and CBF is never being measured directly. This is the main advantage of the model-based approach where several interrelations between CBFV, ABP and ICP are taken into account by the differential equations of the model.

abstract = {The technique of patch clamp recording makes possible the measurement of current flowing through a single ion channel in a cell membrane. Examination of such recordings suggests that the current is quantal in nature, alternating in a seemingly random manner between "on" and "off," but the recordings are corrupted by noise from a variety of sources. In this paper we propose and illustrate methods for restoring the underlying quantal signal from such noisy measurements. The methods use a Markov chain prior distribution for the underlying quantal process and base the restoration on the resulting posterior distribution.},

abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that genetic programming is capable of automatically creating complex networks (such as analog electrical circuits and controllers) whose behavior is modeled by linear and non-linear continuous-time differential equations and whose behavior matches prespecified output values. The concentrations of substances participating in networks of chemical reactions are also modeled by non-linear continuous-time differential equations. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to automatically create (reverse engineer) a network of chemical reactions from observed time-domain data. Genetic programming starts with observed time-domain concentrations of input substances and automatically creates both the topology of the network of chemical reactions and the rates of each reaction within the network such that the concentration of the final product of the automatically created network matches the observed time-domain data. Specifically, genetic programming automatically created metabolic pathways involved in the phospholipid cycle and the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies.},

abstract = {We used paired recordings to study the development of synaptic transmission between inhibitory interneurons of the molecular layer and Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex of the rat. The electrophysiological data were combined with a morphological study of the recorded cells using biocytin or Lucifer yellow staining. Thirty-one interneuron-Purkinje cell pairs were obtained, and 11 of them were recovered morphologically. The age of the rats ranged from 11 to 31 d after birth. During this period synaptic maturation resulted in an 11-fold decrease in the average current evoked in a Purkinje cell by a spike in a presynaptic interneuron. Unitary IPSCs in younger animals exhibited paired-pulse depression, whereas paired-pulse facilitation was found in more mature animals. These data suggest that reduction in transmitter release probability contributed to the developmental decrease of unitary IPSCs. However, additional mechanisms at both presynaptic and postsynaptic loci should also be considered. The decrease of the average synaptic current evoked in a Purkinje cell by an action potential in a single interneuron suggests that as development proceeds interneuron activities must be coordinated to inhibit efficiently Purkinje cells.},

abstract = {Because of the high intracellular Cl- concentration ([Cl-]i) in gastrointestinal smooth muscle, receptor-mediated opening of Cl- channels at the cell resting potential could represent a plausible mechanism for initial receptor-mediated cell depolarization. To test this hypothesis, we characterized activation of large-conductance Cl- channels by the neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor agonist [Sar9,Met(O2)11]-substance P, by specific second messengers, and by direct G protein activation in myocytes isolated from the rabbit colon longitudinal muscle layer. In excised inside-out patches, large-conductance ion channels selective for Cl- over Na+ could be induced by holding the patch at pipette potentials values > 60 mV. The channel showed multiple smaller conductance states (< or = 20) but could open and close via a main gate. When the channel was fully open, its slope conductance was 300 pS, with substates as small as 15 pS, comparable to the predominant conductance observed in cell-attached patches. The voltage-activation profile for full conductance was bell-shaped with maximal open probability (Po) for channel opening of approximately 0 mV. In cell-attached patches, addition of the NK-1 agonist to pipette solution activated a channel that corresponded to a subconductance state of the maxi Cl- channel. The voltage-activation profile for this subconductance state showed a maximal Po value for membrane potentials of approximately 0 mV, with rapid inactivation at more positive and partial inactivation at more negative membrane potentials. In excised inside-out patches, both the full and smaller conductance states of the Cl- channel were activated by the nonhydrolyzable guanosine triphosphate analogue guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and inhibited by pertussis toxin (PTX), whereas [Ca2+]i increased channel activity only in concentrations > 1 mM. In cell-attached patches, addition of different Ca2+ ionophores resulted in channel activation in 10% of cells, and activators of protein kinase A or protein kinase C had no effect. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis of a possible role of G protein-coupled Cl- channels in receptor-mediated initial cell depolarization in longitudinal colonic smooth muscle.},

abstract = {Presynaptic cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) are major mediators of retrograde synaptic plasticity at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and participate in a plethora of physiological functions. Whether presynaptic receptors, such as CB1R, display functionally relevant movements at the surface of neuronal membranes is not known. We analyzed the lateral mobility of native CB1Rs in cortical neurons by using single-quantum dot imaging. We found that CB1Rs are highly mobile and rapidly diffuse in and out of presynapses. Agonist-induced desensitization correlated with a reduction in the fraction of surface CB1Rs and a drastic decrease in the membrane dynamic of the CB1Rs that remained at the presynaptic surface. Desensitization specifically excluded CB1Rs from synapses and increased the fraction of immobile receptors in the extrasynaptic compartment. The results suggest that decrease of mobility may be one of the core mechanisms underlying the desensitization of CB1R, the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor in the brain.},
