## BSX wrapper adding features for optimisation.
## @

# the scalp_mix add-on generates extra outputs based on scalp contribution
# (included because we will probably want to optimise this)
@import scalp_mix

# the pulse add-on overrides all inputs with a pulse defined by parameters
# (again, this allows for optimisation)
@import pulse

# bring in the rest of the model as is
@import scalp
@import bsx_brain
